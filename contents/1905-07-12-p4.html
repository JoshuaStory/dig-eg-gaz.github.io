It has altered the whole attitude of men’s minds towards antiquity, and, to seek an analogy in a widely different quarter, may be compared to the substitution of oral evidence for affidavits in the Court of Chancery. The ancient tomb or inscription, statue or remains of a temple, like the living word of the witness, are more likely to tell the truth than any writing. In no department has the progress been more striking than in Egyptology. A few years ago there was at most one exhibition in the year for showing the work done ; now there are always two or three, and the progress has been so great as to make necessary a division of labour. Thus there is now open, for a month, in the library of the Society of Biblical Arcbæology, 37, Great Russell street, London, a most interesting display of antiquities, mainly from the eleventh dynasty temple at Deire, Bahari, found daring last season’s work by Dr. Edouard Naville and Mr. Hall. This funerary temple of King Neb-hapet-Ra Meutuhetep (ILL) was discovered in the preceding season, 1903 4, and lies to the south of the great temple built by Queen Hatshepsu. Two thirds of it have now been cleared away, and it is hoped that further search may disclose the pyramid tomb of the King himself, which was called Akh-asset, “Glorious are its seats.” From the site the explorers have been allowed to bring home— for distribution among various museums — many valuable, though fragmentary, remains. Had they been more perfect they would perforce have been retained m Egypt. They are of exceptional interest as including specimens of high relief work of which no other examples appear to be extant, and they belong to tho eleventh dynasty, of which we had very little knowledge. These remains have, in fact, opened a new chapter of Egyptian art. The craftsmen of Egypt, like the architects of medieval Cathedrals, are usually unknown by name ; but in this instance the name of the chief artist has come down to us. He was Mertisen, who describes himself on his tombstone as a master of artistic skill which he handed down to his son. It is thought that he was the inaugurator of a new birth of Egyptian art, just as his master, Neb-hap8t-Ra Mentuhetep, was the refounder of the Egyptian kingdom under the headship of the Thebans. Of another King, Usertsen III., three massive statues of black granite—mutilated, it is true, but not to such an extent as to conceal the character of the face—are shown. They represent him at different periods of his life, with a face rather of a European than of an Egyptian or Semitic type. 'The mouth is large, but the lips are thin and firm, and the nose would appear to have been somewhat aquiline. The ears are of enormous size. What appears to be the earliest instance of the newly-discovered eleventh dynasty style of high coloured relief is the seated portrait figure of a Queen or priestess named Nefer shushusa. There are also other similar figures—one with a flower in the left hand, and another smelling a flower. A relief of a King holding the hand of a Queen seems to commemorate a chief of the hunters of the desert by its peculiarly cut inscription. From the shrine of the priestesses comes another high relief sculpture of a man who is represented with the person below him as walking in the temple. The remarkable feature of this fragment is a “proto-Doric” octagonal column, and the whole affords interesting evidence of the actual appearance of the columns of the ambulatory surrounding the pyramid» To the left are two fragments showing the hinder parts of a dog and of a man binding a bull for sacrifice, and above is one of the sacred cows of Hathor licking her calf. Pieces of purely Theban work are two fragments from scenes representing King Mentuhetep and his wife. On the right-hand one is seen the upper part of tho Royal crown, and the beautifully carved hieroglyphs and the wonderful prdservation of colour give singular interest and charm to these remains. The inscriptions refer to the Qneen (Aashait). A complete slab of this type is kept back in the Cairo Museum. A variety of other objects assignable to this period are also shown—the King overthrowing an Aamn, warriors armed with axes, boatmen, and reliefs of animals. The drawing of the latter, notably a flamingo, is marvellously free and accurate. </p><p>The specimens of later dynasties are of no inferior value and interest. The most beautiful, perhaps, of the objects displayed is an alabaster head of a cow, ascribed to the eighteenth dynasty. The sculpture is wonderfully true to life. The eyes were inlaid with lapis, of which traces remain, and the ears and horns were probably of silver. The cow was probably from a figure of the goddess Hathor, dedicated in the Hathor shrine of the Great Temple. A portion of a large funerary stela commemorates Userhat, priest of the deceased Kings Amen-hotep III. and Tut-ankh-amen, and his wife, the singer of Amen, Nefretari. These are ascribed to the early nineteenth dynasty.There is also a great number of smaller objects— beads,blue-glazed faience, vases, hieratic ostraka containing lists of names, accounts, letters, a literary text, and a list of hieroglyphs which may have been school exercises. It remains to b3 said that Dr. Borchardt contributes a series of very beautiful photographs of the temple, and that Mme. Naville has made some admirable coloured drawings of cows from the eleventh dynasty sarcophagi. It is somewhat curious that the draghtsmanship displayed in work presumably of the same age is very unequal. Some of the cows are freely and nataralistically drawn, whilst others are conventional to the degree of being almost wooden. </p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.2. </span><span class="head">MATTERS OF MOMENT.</span><br /><span class="head">THE PITH OF THE HOME PRESS COMMENTS.</span></h3><div class="subsection" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.1"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.1. </span><span class="head">TO EXCLUDE UNDESIRABLES.</span></h4><div class="byline">“Times.”</div><p>The House of Commons was again occupied yesterday with the debate upon the Aliens Bill. That is the third full Parliamentary day devoted to the Committee on this measure, and the House has not reached the middle of the first clause. The amendments have been uniformly directed to making the Bill unworkable, or intolerably cumbrous. It is merely a measure of police for the protection of ratepayers from burdens which ought not to be placed upon them, of English workmen from being crowded out of home and employment by some of the lowest populations of Europe, and of society at large from persons incapable of making good citizens. It is constantly treated by the Opposition as if it were an invasion of the rights of man and an attack upon the privileges of persons more worthy of our care than the subjects of the King. </p></div><div class="subsection" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.2. </span><span class="head">ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION.</span></h4><div class="byline">“Telegraph.”</div><p>The Radicals find themselves in a dilemma, which, as usual, they have made for them selves ; as a witty lady said at the beginning of the last century, “I’ve often heard of people running their heads against stone walls, but I never knew of any but the Whigs who built stone walls to run their heads against” No Radical supports. in ' theory the strange anomaly by which one Member of Parliament represents what may be called a, one-vote power, while another, with only the same privileges in the House of Commons, stands for a ten-vote power. Radicals are mostly ideologues, and equal electoral districts would best coincide with their absurd theories about the literal equality of men, and for that matter of women and men. Why not of men, women, and children Î Therefore, they cannot conscientiously oppose the principle of redistribution. </p></div><div class="subsection" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.3. </span><span class="head">TOO MANY OFFICERS.</span></h4><div class="byline">“Morning Post.”</div><p>If Parliament took a real interest in economy and efficiency for the Army some member would ask for a return showing the number of officers attached to the headquarters of a command and the number of regular troops in the command, on the one hand, in each British command, and, on the other hand, in a normal French or German division and Army Corps. That return, we suspect, would astonish the House of Commons even more than the report of Sir William Butler’s committee. </p></div><div class="subsection" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.4"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.4. </span><span class="head">WAR STORES SCANDAL.</span></h4><div class="byline">“Evening Standard.”</div><p>The suggestion which has been made—it may almost be called a threat—that certain highly placed officials should be impeached, under certain circumstances, in connection with the War Stores scandal, at once takes us back to the days of an earlier generation. One had imagined that Warren Hastings was the last great example of a great impeachment. To day he affair would be less picturesque and dramatic, if not essentially less tragic. Tho galaxy of oratorical talent that made that protracted trial so astounding has passed with the classics from the House of Commons, and oratory as an art is on the down grade. There is, of course, the possibility that an impeachment might serve to revive this lost art, though the possibility lends no sufficient attracting* to the prospect. </p></div><div class="subsection" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.5"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.5. </span><span class="head">THE VICEROY AND LORD KITCHENER</span></h4><div class="byline">“Standard.”</div><p>A practical and satisfactory solution of the difficulty arising out of the original difference of opinion between Lord Curzon and Lord Kitchener is not likely to be facilitated by endeavouring to make it a purely personal question. Far greater issues are at stake than the prestige and reputation of any of the exalted persons who are involved in the controversy. It is one that most be settled on its merits ; and, however interesting it may be to hear that the Viceroy will resign or that the civilian members of his Council would rather perish than survive a military dictatorship, such contingencies, not obscurely hinted at by the Anglo-Indian journals, do not touoh the main point. </p></div><div class="subsection" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.6"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.6. </span><span class="head">REVOLT IN RUSSIA</span></h4><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.6_div.1"><h5><span class="headingNumber">1.2.6.1. </span></h5><div class="byline">“Standard.”</div><p>What Marseilles has been to France, Odessa is to Russia, and there is hardly a centre at which the contagion of military revolt would not have been at work.

This means that the bureaucrats have checked the reformers at every point.......... </p><p>They overthrew Prince Mirsky, whom history may come to regard as the last hope of the Royalists, much as it regards Necker as the last hope of the Bourbons. And it would seem that Yermaloff, the Minister of Agriculture, who dared to tell the Tsar that he was faced I with a revolution, has disappeared also from effective service. The Tsar, in fact, is clearly in the hands of the Grand Dukes, who seems destined to furnish one more example to the  Royal Houses which have, fallen because they “learn nothing, and forget nothing.”</p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.6_div.3"><h5><span class="headingNumber">1.2.6.3. </span></h5><div class="byline">“Manchester Guardian.”</div><p>The mob which went looting in Odessa under the shelter of the Potemkin’s guns was doubtless yielding to the imperious temptation of hunger.

M. Delafosse then inquires what the German Emperor had to reproach France with as regards Morocco. His answer is, absolutely nothing. The German Emperor demanded in haughty terms the territorial integrity of Morocco, the independence of the Sultan, and the open door. But those three points were distinctly accepted in the text of the Franco English Agreement. </p></div><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.7_div.2"><h5><span class="headingNumber">1.2.7.2. </span></h5><div class="byline">“Cologne Gazette.”</div><p>The “Cologne Gazette” declares that in view of the reservations with which M.

WILLIAMS’ PINK PILLS FOR PALE PEOPLE.</span></h3><p>Though sharing the traditional reluctance of our old nobility to emerge from aristocratic privacy and come before the public-as the subject of a newspaper article, the Right Hon. Lady Haldon has expressly permitted the publication of a statement recently made to a representative of the Press regarding her wonderful cure by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. </p><p>Recognising that the words of a titled lady in her position must necessarily bear great' weight with the public, and earnestly </p><div class="figure"><div class="caption">Figure 1. The Lady Haldon.</div><p>From photograph by Johnston and Hoffmann.</p></div><p> desiring that the benefits she had derived from Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills should be publicly acknowledged. Lady Haldon waived all personal reluctance and told a story which cannot but impress every reader.</p><p>‘For the sake of all sufferers,” said her ladyship, “I want to tell you what Dr. Williams* Pink "Pills for Pale People did for me when I had given up all hope, after tho best professional treatment. </p><p>‘I have been a great traveller. Five years ago, when residing Tn Australia, my heart became seriously affected. Symptoms of advanced Anaemia showed themselves. One of the results was most acute Indigestion. I suffered severely in the back and under the shoulder blades, including an especially severe oppression of the chest. The most careful diet brought no relief. Even after a glass of water my discomfort was almost unbearable. Food of any kind caused me snob misery that I ate less and less, till I was practically starving myself. In walking the shortest distance palpitations of the heart would make me feel as though I were suffocating. </p><p>“As anæmia developed I grew alarmingly ill ; I could not sleep at night ; my whole system was deranged. My nerves broke down, my bead ached constantly, until my eyesight became affected. </p><p>“My illness seemed so deeply rooted that I determined to go to the Clinique de la Caroline, in Switzerland, where I was attended by eminent physicians. </p><p>“But about August, 1903, while I was travelling by train and nearly prostrate with one  of my attacks, I casually picked up a small pamphlet referring to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. I became so interested in some cures mentioned therein that I determined to give a trial to this medicine.</p><p>“Within three days I was astonished at the marvelous improvement. I procured further boxes of the pills, and very soon I was delighted to find that all traces of my complaint had practically vanished. </p><p>“I could now walk long distances with an entire freedom from pain. My appetite had returned with a heartiness that surprised me, and my general health was suoh as I had not enjoyed for many years.” </p><p>In every class of society the curative powers of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have been proved repeatedly in diseases arising from too little or impoverished blood. For men as well as women they are invaluable in Anæmia, Indigestion, excessive weakness, Decline, Consumption, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxy, Nervous Disorders.
