PRICE.</span></h4><p>The following telegram has been received at <span class="name">Alexandria</span> to-day from Mr. Theodore Price of <span class="name">New York</span> :—</p><p>Arithmetically to-day’s Government report indicates an American cotton crop for 1905-6 of 10,273,500. This assumes a plant as far advanced as last year’s at this time, and the same remarkably favorable weather hereafter that existed in 1904. The first condition does not exist and cannot be developed; the second is altogether unlikely, reasonably considered, and the trade is therefore called upon to adjust itself to the expectation of a crop of under 10,000,000 bales for the coming season. I hesitate to say what price this means for cotton, but I am confident that it will sell somewhere between twelve and fourteen cents in the near future. People laughed and assailed my sincerity when I predicted this advance, just as they did last year, when on the 3rd of June, 1904, I predicted a crop of 12,000,000 or over. They may so treat this statement, and it is always dangerous to say, “I told you so,” but a lifetime of study devoted to cotton convinces me that we are face to face with revolutionary conditions in the cotton trade. We have marketed the last 14,000,000 bales at practically an average of nine cents a pound. What does this mean for less than 10,000,000 bales ? An imagination restrained by commercial precedent hesitates to answer, but it must be very high. Russo Japanese peace and the Americanisation of the Orient, combined with gold inflation and a famine supply, will produce results as extraordinary as they are regrettable. The one bright spot in the situation is that the South will become by virtue of its cotton monopoly enormously rich.

After forcing the door the thieves made an unsuccessful attempt to break open the iron strong-box and then took it into the street, covering it with a blanket They then hailed an arabieh and drove with the box to a house where one of the party lived. </p><p>On Sunday morning the police heard from the shopkeeper the news of the disappearance of the strong box. A crowd collected at the scene of the robbery, and the arbagi while driving past realised that he had unwittingly aided a burglary the night before, and promptly told his story to the mamour of the kism.</p><p>The police, the arbagi, and the victims of the robbery drove to the house where the box with its contents of over L.E. 800 in gold and shares had been taken. </p><p>On the way the arbagi, keeping up the part of “deus ex machina” which he had assumed, recognised one of his last night’s fares, who was thereupon seized by the policemen. The burglar promptly denounced all his associates to the Hellenic consular authorities. The strong-box was recovered, and the remainder of the gang and a woman were arrested. It seems to us that the public owes to the arbagi this marvellous example of injured virtue taming the tables on vice. </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.21"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.21. </span><span class="head">ANGLO-AMERICAN NILE COMPANY.</span></h4><p>We understand from information received from <span class="name">New York</span>, that it is expected the number of American visitors to Egypt next winter will be greater than that of any previous season, beating last winter's record.
