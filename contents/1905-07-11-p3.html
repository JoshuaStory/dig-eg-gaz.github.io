Durrah and beans, which form the principal ingredient in the diet of the fellah, have reached the price of P,T. 9 to 10 per keila. In spite of the excellent barley crop in the Mariout district, for which the abundant rains of last winter are responsible, the price of barley has risen to from P.T. 63 to 65 per ardeb, against an average of P.T. 45 per ardeb in 1904, when the rain crop was to all intents and purposes non-existent The English and Con­tinental breweries have bought up a very large proportion of this year’s crop, and the barley from the rain belt is evidently in as high request among brewers as ever. The present price of these cereals makes the feeding of horses and cattle a very costly affair. The bersim is over and the poorer owners of cattle and horses are sometimes obliged to give their beasts half rations. </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4_div.1_div.5"><h5><span class="headingNumber">1.4.1.5. </span><span class="head">MORTGAGES IN EGYPT.</span></h5><p>It is stated that the Land Bank of Egypt has announced that it will issue no further loans on mortgages till the end of September.

MR. FREEMAN’S REPORT.</span></h4><p>In his report on the trade of Alexandria for 1904 Mr. Vice-Consul Freeman remarks ;— The answer to the question why the United Kingdom is, or at any rate seems to be, grad­ually losing the largest share in respect of the total imports is perhaps to be found in the wonderfully prosperous condition of the country.i, the greater attention that it consequently, attracts among Continental manufacturers and merchants, and in the keener desire aroused on 9 their part to enter so tempting a market. The contributions of countries other than those specified in the table have more than doubled in the space of four years. Postal parcels and the various goods included under the heading of “Other imports” have likewise doubled in four years. The expansion is spread over all categories and almost all items, and the stock inquiry : “Where are there openings for British trade ?” can best be answered with the one word “everywhere.” But at the same time I can only repeat the 8took advice to manufacturers, jointly or singly, to have agents on the spot and to send more travellers. As the representative of a group of British firms remarked to me, the native tastes may not change, the same class of goods may be in demand for years, but nevertheless local requirements should be studied at the outset, and regular, periodical visits are necessary to ensure a hold on the market. The agents at Alexandria of a British firm dealing in carpenters’ and blacksmiths’ tools and also in Sheffield goods in general wrote to this Con­sulate as follows:—“The difficulty with our principals arises from the fact that the native does not use the same tools as the British workman. Many modifications and additions have consequently to be made so as to adapt the tools to what is required on our markets. If it were a question of a few articles only, the difficulty could easily be overcome by sending home samples ; but as there are a thousand and probably more lines that have to be attended to you will easily understand how impossible it is for an agent who is neither a carpenter nor a blacksmith to give them all the particulars they want. We there­fore suggested that they should send out either one of the partners in their firm or a competent traveller, who, with our help, might secure the first orders. What we have to complain of most in the firms at home is that, although oar markets are invaded by an army 'of foreign travellers, they (the British firms) do not take the trouble or care to incur the expense of sending out competent men to see What others are doing. We may give you as an instance the case of Messrs whose turnover with us was very small until they decided to send out one of the partners of the firm. They are now doing many more thousands than they did hundreds.” </p><p>Another British commercial traveller told me that his quotation for certain goods was 18s. per cwt. (If. 16s. per 100 kilos.) with three months’ credit, while the German quotation, thanks partly to the drawback in Germany, was 25 fr. (1/.) per 100 kilos., with six months’ credit. The British article was of course better, and some people preferred it, but it was not, as the priced would seem to show, worth nearly twice as much as the German article. With such competition as this to face, merchandise, however excellent in itself, can scarcely be left to speak for itself with any prospect of success. I hear of machinery being bought in the United Kingdom by German firms and sold at Alex­andria more cheaply than if it were imported direct. Here again there is surely scope for the energies of a British traveller. </p><p>Inquiries of all kinds are received at this Consulate in ever increasing numbers, and it is becoming almost impossible to answer them all.

A wooden pavilion has been erected in the gardens for the official receptions and a stage has also b3en erected for a variety entertainment which will be given by the troupe of the “Nouveautés.” The gardens are gaily decorated with flags and promise to look most effective when lit up by the numerous Chinese lanterns and electric globes which are hung in every direction. The bands of the 2nd Royal lnniskilling Fusiliers and the Egyptian Cavalry will perform alternately throughout the even­ing, and there will also be a grand display of fireworks. </p><p>All entrances to the gardens except the Boulac one will be closed and this will be opened at 9 p.m. The officers of the Egyptian Army and the Army of Ocupation have accepted the invitation of the committee to assist at the festivities. </p></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.5. </span></h3><p>BECK &amp; CO’S PILSENER BEER BREMEN.

If this business is concluded the directors have no hesitation in saying that it will be a most satis­factory investment for the company. The direc­tors are also on the point of completing the purchase of some very valuable budding land in Alexandria which has been strongly recommended to them by their local advisers. The directors feel that when these transactions are concluded the shareholders will have a considerable interest in the heart of the two most important cities in Egypt—namely, Cairo and Alexandria, which cannot fail to give most satisfactory results. In view of the growing importance of the Egyptian Mining industry, the directors are supporting on favorable terms the issue of the Egyptian Gold and Emerald Company, Ltd. In this they are acting in conjunction with the United African Explo­rations, Ltd. The Egyptian Gold and Emerald Company, Ltd., is formed to acquire what appears to be one of the most important mineral concessions in Egypt The concession comprises an area of some 3,000 square miles, and it is reported upon by responsible engineers as being rich in gold, silver, lead, copper and emerald mines. The directors have also before them various proposals, which are-likely to materialise shortly, for the development of sound and profitable business in other direc­tions. The Board have elected Mr. Charles H. Rigg as a director to represent his substantial financial interest in the company. </p><p>July 5 was fixed by the committee of the London Stock Exchange as a special settling day in Egyptian Land and General Trust, Limited, 200,000 shares of £1 each, 5s paid (Nos. 1 to 200,000). </p></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">SPORT AND PLAY.</span></h2><div class="item" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.1. </span></h3><p>KHEDIVIAL YACHT CLUB, REGATTA.

At most of the junctions of two streets cabstands exist, and the cabmen appear to think that they have a right to stand in such a manner that the passage of pede­strians is entirely obstructed. The cabmen naturally wish to look for fares along both roads, and draw up their cabs accordingly, the general public have to go round them in the middle of the road, which has pos­sibly been recently watered. The stand opposite the Cafe Chicha is perhaps one of the worst cases in point There is always a policeman on duty at this place, but he does nothing to ameliorate the nuisance, and when complained to it is with the greatest difficulty that one can drive into his head that the cabman is in any way out of order. Personally, I invariably insist on the cab being removed. Sometimes I am met with abuse or stolid resistance, but, being fluent in the language, I finally get my way. Frequently the cabman returns to his former position immediately I have passed, and remains there. It surely would be an easy matter to explain to the policemen, either individually or collectively when on parade, the rights of pedestrians, or simpler still, to pat a red paint mark on the footpath indicating the limits of the cabstand.

P. C. A. are in evidence for support, bat at Port Said at least they are not likely to get much as long as the dis­gusting scenes occur while cattle are being landed. The poor beasts are slung by the feet or horns, kept for hours without water, most likely from the port at which they embark, and on landing try to drink from the sea. </p><p>On Tuesday the passengers on a ship in quarantine (therefore unable to take steps) were entertained by the following exhibition of cruelty. A cow ran away from the herd and was chased out on the breakwater by three or four savages, her tail was twisted, she was stoned on the head and body with rocks of about 20 lbs., beaten unmercifully with battens 3 inches thick, sticks were thrust into her anus and vagina, she was thrown off the breakwater into the sea, a fall of 12 feet, dragged over the rocks that cut her hide, hauled up again in a most brutal fashion, her horns torn off and blood was streaming from her nostrils. This performance took about two hours. We are used to seeing acts of cruelty, but not such refined brutality as this. If the S. P. C. A. has a representative, he should be on the spot where these things happen or else he is not much use.—I am, etc., </p><div class="byline">A Lover of Animals.</div><div class="dateline">Port Said, July 8.</div></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">CHRONIQUE F1NANCIERE</span></h2><div class="dateline">(1er-10 Juillet)</div><p>Encore sous l’influence de la liquidation de fin du mois, notre marché a débuté calme et insignifiant On s’attendait même à ce que cet état de marasme durut toute la semaine, lorsque l’heureuse issue des négociations franco-allemandes et la nomination définitive de ministres plénipotentiaires russo-japonais en vue de la paix ont remis à flot les bourses européennes ; ce qui a été d’autant plus facile que le capital abonde en Europe. </p><p>A tons ces motifs de hausse est encore venu s’ajouter un facteur important: la reprise soudaine et considérable des cotons à la suite du rapport du Bureau d’Agriculture de Washington sur les prévisions de la prochaine récolte.
