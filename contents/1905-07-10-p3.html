He accordingly mixed powdered datura leaf with their food and when asked to eat with them, refused. Within an hour of the meal, the sheikh and his three daughters showed symptoms of datura poisoning. The principal medical officer of the moudirieh was called in, and recognising the symptoms, asked the son why he would not eat with his family. His answers proving unsatisfactory, the boy was searched and the poison found in his pockets. The sheikh and his daughters, who are still dangerously ill, have been sent to the hospital at Minieh.

The S.S. “Iraouaddy,” of the same company, has just arrived from the canal, haying on board the remaining 360, all of whom were picked up by the Russian Volunteer cruiser “Rion” (ex “Smolensk”) on the 1st inst, and landed at Aden, at which port the “Rion” was obliged to coal, she having burned all her woodwork and fittings to enable her to reach Aden. </p><p>In an interview which I had with two of the passengers of the “Chadoc,” I learned that the vessel went ashore at 4 a.m. close under Guardafui on the 26th ulto. and that most of the ship’s boats were broken up.</p><p>The Somalis, many of whom spoke French, having served in the “Haussas,” took the whole number, including 80 children, off the vessel, only one being lost in the rescue operations. The passengers in many cases were able to save their personal effects, and the steward’s department to disembark a quantity of provisions. The natives built them rude huts of twigs and gorse and treated them all with considerable kindness, which belies the general idea entertained that the men of that coast are utter savages.</p><p>After four days spent in the village, they were able to attract the attention of the “Rion” by means of a signal staff erected on a sand-hill to the north of the Cape and were all embarked (save one, who was lost two days before) on the Russian vessel, arriving at Aden all well on the morning of the 4th July.</p><p>By the “Polynesien” there also arrived 190 Russian refugees, who were transferred to the S.S. “Tchihatchoff,” which vessel sailed last night direct for Odessa.</p><p>M.

Since then, land has been let in large quantities for the erection of bath houses on the beach, and now, instead of the gambling and so on being carried on in one large building, there are at least 20 or 30 in which the wildest of orgies take place nightly. Not content with that, the whole line of beach is now filthy in the extreme and a grave menace to health—and the police do not see that which is plain to every resident.</p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.7_div.3"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.7.3. </span><span class="head">NAVAL BAND CONCERT.</span></h4><p>The concert given by the British naval band last night was attended by a large number of residents and visitors.
