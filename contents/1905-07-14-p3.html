Of this gross increase Great Britain, unfortunately, has no share, her figures for the same period being practically identical, though the balance of L.E. 839 is on the wrong side. </p><p>The principal contributor to the month’s total increase is flour, which is up by L.E. 49,700. Out of a value of LE. 91,529 England only supplied L.E. 5,200 ,but, nevertheless, although our trade in this article is still very small, we are pleased to record an increase of L.E. 4,459 over May 1904 and of L.E. 2,889 compared with last April. There is, however, still room for expansion, especially when we remember that about four years ago Great Britain was responsible for some 12 % of the total flour imports. </p><p>Cotton fabrics have advanced by L.E. 12,177, though there is a loss of L.E. 8,367 if compared with the previous month. The figures under this heading for the first five months of 1905 show an increase of LE. 209,045 over the corresponding period of 1904, though 6 % of such gain is accounted for by the augmentation—as from the 1st December last—of the Customs tariff for estimating the value of the goods. A further reason for this large increase is that merchants during the autumn refrained from buying in the hope of lower prices. They were, however, forced to purchase in February as manufacturers at that time were being booked up for months ahead by other countries. Apart from all this, however, the bulk of the total gain is due to the great development of the country, and the consequent increased spending power of the people. </p><p>The imports of oxen and furniture are respectively L.E. 9,046 and 8,785 higher than in May 1904. For obvious reasons the latter item should still further increase, and we only hope British manufacturers will make an effort to obtain a satisfactory share of the additional trade. </p><p>Coal is L.E. 5,753 to the good, though since the commencement of the year the figures show the enormous loss of L.E. 123,067. The main cause of this decrease lies in the fact that during last October, November, and December very large shipments were made with the inevitable result that sufficient accommodation could not be found, and supplies had to be stopped. About March the coal stocks began to move, and shipments recommenced. </p><p>The chief decreases between May 190e-4 are those of L.E. 18,360 under petroleum, LE. 11,676 in raw silk and thread, and LE. 13,173 under the heading “Brass, copper, and bronze goods.” In the latter case, the 1905 figures are lessened by all imports of brass bedsteads which are now included in the return for “Iron and ironwork.” </p><p>Jewellery, of which England’s contribution to the total supply was nil—against L. E. 7,721 in 1904,—is less by L. E. 7,202, another decrease being noted under wood, which is lower by L. E. 9,140. </p><p>As regards England’s imports during the two months in question the main variations were an increase of L E. 11,801 in cotton fabrics, and a loss of LE. 14,714 under “Brass, copper, and bronze goods”. </p><p>The home country’s figures for iron and ironwork show an increase of L E. 6,392, which, however, is counterbalanced by a decrease of L. E. 7,721 in jewellery.</p><p>An additional L.E. 8,751 gained in furniture —obtained largely through the requirements of the Sudan—was nullified by a loss of L E. 9,292 under the heading of “Other Machinery”. </p><p>Coal imports from England are higher by LE. 5,471, but cereals (excluding wheat and maize) are down by LE. 3,711. </p><p>Although the total returns from all countries compare favorably with May 1904, they do not show up well when placed alongside those for April 1905, there being a net decrease of L.E. 69,280, or 4.3 % between the two months. The most unsatisfactory feature, however, of the case is the fact that the whole of this decrease is borne by Great Britain, which, in addition, suffers by the gain of L.E. 1,501 credited to the rest of the world. Her total shrinkage is thus one of LE. 70,781, which is largely accounted for by losses of L.E. 21,684 in coal, L.E. 16,577 in machinery, L.E. 9,219 in instruments, LE. 7,739 in woollen fabrics and L.E. 6,053 under the classification of “Other Textiles.” </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.6"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.6. </span><span class="head">NORTH EGYPT LAND COMPANY.</span></h3><p>With reference to the recent reports to the effect that the above company is about to return the subscriptions to the applicants for shares owing to these being insufficient, we are informed that the directors are about to conclude an arrangement with the underwriters which will enable them to proceed to a completion of the business. </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.7"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.7. </span><span class="head">SAN STEFANO CASINO.</span></h3><p>The following is the menu of the dinner to be served to-morrow evening on the occasion of the small dance :—</p><ul><li class="item">Crême de volaille à la reine</li><li class="item">Loup de roche Norvégienne</li><li class="item">Filet mignon à la Mascotte</li><li class="item">Chaud froid de poularde à la Strasbourgeoise </li><li class="item">Carottes et petite pois an beurre</li><li class="item">Faisan d’Ecosse rôti grande chaase</li><li class="item">Salade de saison</li><li class="item">Glace Vénitienne</li><li class="item">Gâteau aux avelines</li><li class="item">Fruits Dessert</li></ul></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.8"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.8. </span><span class="head">THE YEMEN REVOLT.</span><br /><span class="head">MANIFESTO TO THE ARABS.</span></h3><p>The leader of the rising in the Yemen has issued a manifesto whioh opens as follows :—</p><p>"To all the followers and adherents devoted to the Book of God (Koran) the laws of His messenger and His pure family, who are the security of the people of the land from every calamity, the Ark of Salvation, the interpreters of the Book, and the comrades inseparable till the Day of Doom : whenever a star setteth there ariseth another star, a guiding light of the fountain-head of religion. And we are through God in a protection unshaken by fears and a manifest proof unconcealed by futile words. And the reason for this general proclamation is what God has made oar duty, namely, to remind and to exhort when the sight has become blinded and the first symptoms of humiliation, degradation, and despair have happened among the Arabs. Know that God tries His servants to discriminate between the true and false. As the Koran says : ‘Verily We shall assuredly try you so that We may know the strivers and the patient amongst you.’ ”</p><p>The manifesto then declares that the Arabs have been tried by the incursion of the Turks, whom it describes as foreigners and accuses of various offences. It continues :</p><p>“In spite of all this the Arabs are helping them with their wealth and best provisions and doing harm to their Mussulman brethren : and the Arabs have despaired of fighting them and chastising them although they are among the Arabs like a drop : nor do the Arabs seize the opportunity of being allowed to bear arms which will be soon taken away from them if their negligence continues, and their children will be carried off as hostages in the regular army if the delay is prolonged. . . . What is the matter with you, ye semblances and shadows of men, that you do not defend your spiritual and temporal rights, your arms, and your children, and drive them from land to land, from vale to vale, till you annihilate them like the tribe of Ad, as did your noble ancestors of old? And the hearts of the Arabs in most parts of Yemen have become emboldened, and God is with you and after Him, we are in your succour, and soon shall we write to the Sheikh Nasir-al-Din Ali Bin Magdad (may God protect him) to cast his eye towards you if you be of the truthful.” </p><p>[The Sheikh Nasir-al-Din is the Commander-in-Chief of the rebel Army.] </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.9"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.9. </span><span class="head">SUDAN LAW COURTS.</span></h3><p>The latest “Sudan Gazette” to hand contains certain regulations relating to the Moslem Law Courts in the Sudan.

Again, if the High Court requires further evidence before annulling or confirming a decision under Sections 27 and 28 of the Sudan Code, it may either summon the parties to appear before it, or commission for the purpose the Court in whose jurisdiction they reside, while if the High Court annuls a judgment on account of the incompetence of the Court which gave it, it may order the re-hearing of the case by the competent Court. </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.10"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.10. </span><span class="head">SHARAKI LANDS.</span></h3><p>The following <span style="font-style:italic">arrêté</span> has been issued by the Minister of Public Works :—</p><p>Art. ler.

We are glad to see that original articles are now appearing, the first place in this month’s number being held by a most readable contribution, which we attribute to the new secretary of the Chamber, entitled “Points for Manufacturers,” which sums up the causes that prevent British manufacturers and traders from deriving as much benefit as they might from the increased prosperity of Egypt. The article deals with legal questions that affect commerce with foreign countries, with the selection of agents, and the need for commercial travellers, and though the writer seems to assign too much importance to public opinion in Egypt, after all, an article with nothing in it to criticise might be unreadable from its very orthodoxy. The articles on the month's imports have commenced, and we are glad to see that the statistics referring to the Customs returns have been amplified and now show Great Britain’s position compared with the previous year’s figures during the current year. The stock and share lists have also been entirely revised and brought up to date.
