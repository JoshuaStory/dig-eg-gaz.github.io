The deceased, who succumbed to cancer of the liver, had been ailing for some considerable time past, but it was only within the past week that fears were entertained of a fatal issue. Indeed, it was Sheikh Mohamed Abdou's intention to have left a week or two ago on a voyage to Europe and Morocco. However, “Man proposes and God disposes,’’ and the sheikh who has done so much, and seemed destined to do so much more, for the enlightenment of his co-religionists has passed away at the comparatively early age of 57 years. His death will be deeply mourned, not only by the Moslems in Egypt, and indeed throughout the East, but by a large number of friends and admirers of other faiths. </p><p>The deceased’s body, which is to be interred at Cairo, was removed this morning from Mohamed Bay Rasim’s house at Seffer station, where he died, and conveyed by tram-car to the Ramleh Railway terminus, where it arrived at 10 o’clock. On its arrival there the body was met by all the notables who were able to be present, among whom we noticed the Acting Regent, Hussein Pasha Fakhry, Riaz Pasha, Mazloum Pasha, Aziz Pasha Izzet, Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Ibrahim Pasha Neguib, Under-Secretary, Ministry of the Inferior, Mr. Mansfield de C. Findlay, British Charge d’Affaires, the President of the Court of Appeal and other judges of the various Courts, in their robes of office, the Sub-Governor, Abdul Halim Pasha Assem, Mahmoud Pasha Fehmy, Mr. Ralli and many other members of the Municipality, the Cadi of Alexandria and the Mufti Nakib el Ashraf, El Said Abdul Rahitn el Dunerdachi, Mohamed Shakir, Sheikh el Ulema, etc. Escorted by detachments of Cavalry, Infantry, Police, and Coastguardsmen, the pupils of the Orwa el Woska and Makarim el Akhlak Schools, and the Porters’ Benevolent Society, the imposing procession started for Moharrem Bey station, where a special train, which had been placed at the disposal of the family by the Railway Administration, was in readiness to convey the body to Cairo. </p><p>This train left at 11 a.m. for Cairo, where it was due to arrive at 2 p.m. Among those who accompanied the mortal remains of the late Grand Mufti to the Capital were Mohamed Shakir, Sheik el-Ulema, and the other ulema of Alexandria, besides the family and relatives of the deceased, who had come down from Cairo to be present with him at the end. On their arrival at Cairo the remains will be taken to the Al Azhar Mosque for the usual ceremony, after which the interment will take place at El Megawreen Cemetery. </p><p>The late Sheikh Mohamed Abdou was born at Mehallet Nasr, Sheibrakhit district, Behera, in 1848, his father being Sheikh Abdou, a cultivator. He was educated at Al Azhar University and in the year 1295 A.H. received the final certificate of the “Alimieh.” He was appointed editor of the “Official Journal,” aud having been accused of being one of the mutineers of the revolution, was exiled and condemned in 1882. Going to Beyrout, he there married the daughter of Sheikh Hamada. At Beyrout he engaged in religious and theological studies, and was finally pardoned in 1892. Shortly after arriving in Egypt he became judge of the Court of First Instance at Benha and afterwards at Zagazig. He was then promoted to a judgeship in the Native Court of Appeal. In June, 1899, he was appointed Grand Mufti of Egypt by H.H, the Khedive in place of Sheikh Hassouna el Nawawi, and was a member of the Council of Administration of Al Azhar from 1894 until his retirement recently. </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1_div.5"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.1.5. </span><span class="head">NILE BRIDGES.</span></h4><p>We learn that no project for the construction of a bridge from Boulac to Ghezireh has as yet been decided upon, but the question is receiving full consideration at the hands of the officials of the Public Works Department, who recognise the great advantage to be derived by direct communication with Ghezireh by the continuation of Boulac road by means of bridge. Soundings have been taken and various schemes have been examined, but no decision can be arrived at until the return of the many Government officials who are at present away on leave. We also learn that an offer for the supply of funds has been made by a local syndicate. We are unable to learn the terms upon which this offer was made, but the acceptance of it is, we understand, very doubtful.</p><p>Before any such scheme can be finally fixed upon we anticipate seeing the work of widening the Kasr el Nil Bridge started, and this will be a great advantage for its present width makes it altogether inadequate for the immense amount of traffic which passes over it. The work will, we understand, be commenced before the completion of the bridge at present in course of construction at Rodah, and therefore there will be no means of decreasing the traffic, which will of necessity become much more congested by the space which will be sacrificed to the work of widening. Would it not be better to delay the alteration of the Kasr el Nil Bridge until such time as there is another bridge to relieve the traffic to some extent ?</p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1_div.6"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.1.6. </span></h4><p>CARLTON HOTEL Bulkeley, Ramleh.

It having, however, been found that the total number of corvéables in the whole province was no longer sufficient to cope with the pest, the Ministry of the Interior authorised the importation of 800 boys from Gharbieh, and within 24 hours of the reception of the order the whole number was despatched and placed at the disposal of the Moudir of Behera. It is hoped that the total number now engaged in Behera province, more than 50,273, will suffice to deal with the eggs as fast as they are laid and avert the possibility of serious damage. </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1_div.8"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.1.8. </span><span class="head">RUSSIAN CRUISER AT SUEZ.</span></h4><div class="byline">(From our Correspondent.)</div><div class="dateline">Suez, Tuesday.</div><p>The Russian cruiser Rion arrived at 10.30 last night and entered the Canal at four o’clock this morning. </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1_div.9"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.1.9. </span><span class="head">FIRE AT LUXOR STATION.</span></h4><p>A telegram from our Keneh Correspondent states that a fire occurred yesterday at 2 p.m. in Luxor station, burning 450 sacks of tibn and some railway fencing.

The project is signed by Emir Zadé, Khalil Bey, and M. Tchimara. </p><p>It is announced that a group of Hellenes, natives of Volo, have decided to create a Thessalian Steamship Company, with a regular service between Egypt, Constantinople, and the ports of the Black Sea. The object of this company is to facilitate the exportation of the products of Thessaly to Egypt and Turkey. It is announced also that negotiations have been opened for the purchase of three new steamers of 5,000 tons each, with a speed of from 15 to 17 knots. </p></div><div class="article" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1_div.15"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.1.15. </span><span class="head">THE MAKING OF THE SUDAN.</span></h4><p>A little while ago a paragraph in “The African World” announced the fact that the Suakin Railway would be completed early next year. Subsequent advices show that the work of construction is being pushed ahead with commendable energy. The value of the line to the Sudan and its population cannot be over-estimated. It will carry goods from Khartoum to the sea in twenty-four hours, where six days are now required for transportation along the 1,500 miles of rail and river between the Sudan and the Egyptian ports. The advantages of the new arrangement are so manifest as hardly to need mention. It is safe to say that no single factor will contribute so largely to the development of the great territory won from the Mahdi. The Sudan is capable of great fruitfulness. Cotton and grain it should produce in abundance. But markets are essential. The Suakin Railway provides the shortest cut to the markets, which, without that or another railway, might, so far as the Sudan is concerned, as well be non-existent.

There is no reason for it, the signals are meaningless and not in conformity with the International Code; they are also misleading. The Germans are the worst offenders, but they cannot take a ship in or out of port without music. Once upon a time a steamer that whistled for her agent had to wait half-an-hour after the last performance, but that good rule has dropped into abeyance. In Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, etc., anybody can indulge in the luxury of waking the town up with the whistle, but he has to pay a heavy fine for his fun, and there is no reason why it should not be same at Port Said. Steamers also leave their masthead and sidelights on when fast to the buoys in a most casual manner, so that it is impossible to tell if they are under weigh or not: this will lead to a serious accident some day. </p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1_div.17"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.1.17. </span><span class="head">SPORT AND PLAY.</span></h4><div class="subsection" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1_div.17_div.1"><h5><span class="headingNumber">1.1.17.1. </span><span class="head">A.

P. G.</div><p>While I walked about the slopes N. of Ma’ân and watched the trains steaming out with railway material, sleepers, rails, ballast, and so forth to carry on the line to the south, I suddenly noticed that it was growing strangely dark and that a brutally cold wind had sprung up. I next discovered that it was raining half a mile away and that the rain was moving rapidly in my direction. There was no sort of shelter anywhere near me : I was a good mile from the station, the nearest tents were a good half-mile away, and it struck me that a European rushing into a tent might cause considerable surprise and annoyance to its occupants. In this I was mistaken for there were several Italian workmen at Ma’ân, and soldiers were quite familiar with the sight of Europeans, but had I thus sought refuge the chances were in favor of my getting into a tent where Turkish women were quartered and causing a panic among their spouses. One always does the wrong thing under such circumstances, and after my experience with the tinned meat I had no desire to tempt fortune any farther. </p><p>The rain arrived while I was looking aimlessly about me, preceded by a violent gale that caught up all the dust in the desert for the rain which followed it to lay again. Then came the rain and soaked me to the skin but brought its recompense with it. While I ran down a gully looking for some cleft or projecting rock where I could take cover, I put up two gazelles which dashed like the wind across the wadi, disappeared over a slope, and appeared again a moment later like two brown flecks on the black plain that ran eastward. </p><p>When I got back to the station I found a Circassian, who was helping the Greek station-master, and would no doubt become a station-master himself one day. He frowned and made fearful grimaces, which were emphasised by the rugged ferocity of his features, over what appeared to be a piece of simple addition. M. Nikola, the station-master, turned to me from time to time with a resigned gesture of amused contempt while his subordinate, gripping the pen as if it were a dagger, made error after error, which he corrected with the aid of sand and a stout penknife. M. Nikola ordered tea with lemons (Ma’ân supplies no milk) and we drank, the Circassian in particular disposing of several cups and dipping his pen into ink or tea with a sublime indifference. </p><p>The station-master was called away, the Circassian put away his papers, eyed me, and then said something ending in—orsun. I took it to mean “can you speak Tarkish” and replied in my best kitchen Arabic, that splendid language spoken by Englishmen to their Egyptian servants and learnt from the industrious Berberin, who, as everyone knows has <span style="font-style:italic">such</span> a good pronunciation of Arabic. To my joy the Tcherkess answered me in equally bad and simple Arabic, and we conversed with numerous pauses while we wrestled with the right phrases that refused to be uttered or even remembered. A soldier from Aleppo grinned at our Arabic solecisms and threw in a word now and again.</p><p>Yes ! I came from Egypt and Aziz Effendim from—well, I doubt if he knew himself. He had been in Egypt, had seen the Zoological Gardens, where an elephant had impressed him, and knew the Mousky quarter. He also had been to a theatre in the Esbekieh. Fearing “startling disclosures” I changed the subject and asked him how he liked Egypt . . but alas ! he absolutely refused to puff the British Occupation or say a word for the Agency. The utmost he would allow was that Lord Cromer was skilled in “politika.” For him Egypt was a hopeless place where you could not ride about after the manner of Hybrias the Cretan, armed and overbearing, and where fighting was forbidden. His brother had been as far as Italy and had fought a duel there. He himself had been to Aleppo, where the people were like mules, bastards, neither Turk nor Arab (this to the address of the Halebi soldier), and thieves. He had been at Diarbekir and Kharpat in the time of the troubles, where he killed three Armenians with his revolver while they ran, and “we destroyed all of them and burnt their houses.” Inshallah, there would be a war with the Bulgarians soon. As for the Ingliz, why did they wish to take Arabia and sell guns to the rebels?
