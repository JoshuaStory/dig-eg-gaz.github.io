2. Log on to one of the six microfilm-enabled computers, and open the "Microform PowerScan" program. Indicate that you are using microfilm. Thread the film into the microfilm reader (a "ScanPro 1000"), carefully following the threading route mapped on the machine itself. Run a bit of film through the machine until you begin to see page images--the first foot of film is only black.
3. Familiarize yourself with the controls at the bottom of the program. The "Motorized Roll Film Control" allows you to move through the film and find the issue you need. The larger "Adjust Image" menu has numerous controls. If your image is only displaying as half screen, click the "Film Orientation" button and it will shift to full screen. You can play with the zoom until you see a whole page on the screen--you may have to move the carriage in the microfilm reader itself to center the image. You can focus, change the brightness, straighten the image, and so on. 
4. Once your page is centered and fills the screen, you are ready to save it as an image file. Change the shape of the green box, which shows the part of the image that you will save to a file, so that it contains the edes of the print. Under the Scan/Print tab, change the scan resolution to 600dpi. Press "Scan to Drive #1." Name your file following the standard dating format (YYYY-MM-DD-p1) and chosing type jpg (though the compression might cause some problems in OCR). Go ahead and do the same for all the pages of the issue.
5. Find the files on the computer's hard drive, and copy them to a USB key, save the to Dropbox, or save them some other way. Do not simply leave them on the microfilm computer.
6. Return the microfilm to the checkout desk--your classmates will need to find it.

## Note on resolution
The next step in your work is [OCR (optical character recognition)](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/how-to/OCR-instructions/). In that step, a computer program will "read" the image files you've just created and spit out a text file that says what the newspaper says. It is inevitable that there will be a mistakes in this OCRed file, but if the image resolution is too low, the OCR process will not work very well. You may find that it will be necessary to scan the pages in four high-resolution quarters, then stich them together into a single high-resolution file. If you are on Windows, the [Microsoft Image Composite Editor](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/ice/) is a free and easy way to stitch images.
