## If you are using Windows:
1. Download [AABBY Finereader](http://trial.abbyyusa.com/download-fr12pro). The 30-day, 100-page free trial that they offer *should* be enough time to complete your OCR work for this class. If you don't complete it on time, you have the option to buy the software for about $100.
2. Open the program, then open the image file of the 3rd page of the issue you scanned (pages 1 and 2 have lots of ads in them, and are a more complicated place to start). When you open the document, Finereader will automatically read it. Let it do its work.
3. Once the initial read is complete, you'll need to make sure that it's defined the areas correctly. The areas are the green-bordered boxes of text. Often the machine will skip a word, or draw an extra few words in from a different column. You need to have the whole text read in the proper order, so you'll want to reshape these boxes so that they cover the text correctly. I've sometimes found that it's best just to drag one box so that it covers a whole column.
4. Once the boxes cover all of the text, you need to make sure that they're in the right sequence. Click the tool on the left hand menu with a blue down arrow and a red up arrow. This is the tool to reorder the areas of text.
4. It is possible that your page contains text in French. If this is the case, enclose that text in its own area and set the language (in the "Area Properties" tab at the bottom of the screen) to French.
5. Once the sequence of areas is correct, click the "read" icon again. The program will reread the text in the order you've indicated.
6. Click on the "verification" icon, and proceed to correct the text. When verifying the text, remember that you are only correcting the automatic reading. *Do not* correct any errors you might find in the newspaper itself--not even minor spelling errors. We want to preserve the newspaper in its original text, warts and all.
7. Once you've verified some or all of the text, save your verification work. (If you close Finereader without saving the verification separately, you will lose your work). To do this, use the "Save" icon in the middle top of the page. Choose "Plain text" as the document layout, and click "Save." Name the document following the standard format of YYYY-MM-DD-p#. If you click "Format options," and check "Use blank line as paragraph separator," it will make your work easier later on. You can now close Finereader without losing your verification work.
8. Once you've finished work on the page, upload it to your personal GitHub repository.

## If you are using Mac:
This is one of the rare instances when you may be better off using Windows. If you can get ahold of a Windows machine and use Finereader following the instructions above, that's it may be easiest. (The Mac version of Finereader lacks a verification tool, and will only allow you to download three pages.)

That said, I've had good preliminary results with [Cisdem PDFConverterOCR](https://www.cisdem.com/pdf-converter-ocr-mac.html). I'm not sure how long their free trial lasts, but it's worth a try, and can also be purchased for $60. Follow the directions below.

(There are other options, too, but none seems to work as well as Cisdem: you could try the 10-day, 100-page trial of [Readiris Pro](http://www.irislink.com/EN-US/c1195/10-Day-FREE-Trial---Experience-Readiris-Pro-15--OCR-Software-.aspx?utm_source=IRISLINK&utm_medium=Popup&utm_campaign=Popup-trial). [PDF OCR X Community Edition](http://solutions.weblite.ca/pdfocrx/download_mac) also didn't do a great job, but it's free.

Instructions for Cisdem:

1.  Open the program, then open the image file of the 3rd page of the issue you scanned (pages 1 and 2 have lots of ads in them, and are a more complicated place to start). When you open the document, Cisdem will automatically analyze it. Let it do its work.
3. Cisdem seems to recognize newspaper columns quite well, and you can probably simply proceed to OCR once the recognition is finished and correct by hand later. But if you notice egregious errors, reshape the green boxes.
5. Select "Save as text" as the output format, and click convert. Wait. When you are offered the option to save the document, name it following the standard format of YYYY-MM-DD-p#.
6. Once you have saved the text file, open it and proceed to correct the text. It may be most convenient to have the image file on one half of the screen and your text editor on the other. When verifying the text, remember that you are only correcting the automatic reading. *Do not* correct any errors you might find in the newspaper itself--not even minor spelling errors. We want to preserve the newspaper in its original text, warts and all.
8. Once you've finished work on the page, upload it to your personal GitHub repository.


## FAQs

### How many errors should I expect to find?

If you find a very large number of errors, you might consider re-scanning the page at a higher resolution or a better focus.

### How do I deal with accented letters?

Preserve all accents (e.g. in words like d√©but). You will need to enter accents as single characters. To do so, use the extended keyboard. Here are some pointers for [Windows](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aihp) and [Mac](http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemac.html).
