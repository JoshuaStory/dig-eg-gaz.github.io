1. Download [AABBY Finereader](http://trial.abbyyusa.com/download-fr12pro). The 30 day, 100 page free trial that they offer *should* be enough time to complete your OCR work for this class. If you don't complete it on time, you have the option to buy the software for about $100. The Windows version works better than the Mac version.
2. Open the program, then open the image file of the 3rd page of the issue you scanned (pages 1 and 2 have lots of ads in them, and are a more complicated place to start). When you open the document, Finereader will automatically read it. Let it do its work.
3. Once the initial read is complete, you'll need to make sure that it's defined the areas correctly. The areas are the green-bordered boxes of text. Often the machine will skip a word, or draw an extra few words in from a different column. You need to have the whole text read in the proper order, so you'll want to reshape these boxes so that they cover the text correctly. I've sometimes found that it's best just to drag one box so that it covers a whole column.
4. Once the boxes cover all of the text, you need to make sure that they're in the right sequence. Click the tool on the left hand menu with a blue down arrow and a red up arrow. This is the tool to reorder the areas of text.
4. It is possible that your page contains text in French. If this is the case, enclose that text in its own area and set the language (in the "Area Properties" tab at the bottom of the screen) to French.
5. Once the sequence of areas is correct, click the "read" icon again. The program will reread the text in the order you've indicated. 
6. Click on the "verification" icon, and proceed to correct the text. When verifying the text, remember that you are only correcting the automatic reading. *Do not* correct any errors you might find in the newspaper itself--not even minor spelling errors. We want to preserve the newspaper in its original text, warts and all.
7. Once you've verified some or all of the text, save your verification work. (If you close Finereader without saving the verification separately, you will lose your work). To do this, use the "Save" icon in the middle top of the page. Choose "Plain text" as the document layout, and click "Save." Name the document following the standard format of YYYY-MM-DD-p#. If you click "Format options," and check "Use blank line as paragraph separator," it will make your work easier later on. You can now close Finereader without losing your verification work.
8. Once you've finished work on the page, upload it to your personal GitHub repository.

## FAQs

### How many errors should I expect to find?

If you find a very large number of errors, you might consider re-scanning the page at a higher resolution or a better focus.

### How do I deal with accented letters?

Preserve all accents (e.g. in words like d√©but). You will need to enter accents as single characters. To do so, use the extended keyboard. Here are some pointers for [Windows](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aihp) and [Mac](http://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemac.html).
