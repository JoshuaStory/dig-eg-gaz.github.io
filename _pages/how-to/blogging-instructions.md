## 1. Fork the repository

Fork a copy of the organization [blog-posts](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/blog-posts) repository on your personal github account. Do this by clicking on the "fork" icon on the top right. You will be offered the chance to fork the repository under your own username--do so. This will make a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, in which you should save your draft blog posts.

## 2. Name your post

Open the default file that the forked repository contains in a text editor (such as Atom) and save it with a unique name following this format: `2016-09-01-post-name.md`. Plug in today's date and a distinctive name for your post.

## 3. Fill in the header

The header (the material in the opening lines of the document, between the two --- lines) is very important. It tells the website how to treat your blog post. Give your post at tile, enter the date and your name, and give it a few content tags. If you like, write a short teaser. Enter the name of an image that you would like to appear beside the post.

## 4. Write a post in markdown and add images

You will write your text using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a very simple markup language but a different one from xml, which you are using for the newspaper pages. Here's a [tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and here's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Aim for at least 200 words, but it's fine if you write more. Integrate some links into your post, and use an image or two.

## 5. Working with images

To include images, add a line to your post in the following format: `![Image label](image-file-name.png)`. Save these images in the forked folder.

## 6. Send a pull request to the group repository

When your blog post and image are ready, you can fold them back into the organization content repository by sending me a **pull request**. You do this by clicking the "new pull request" button the top left above your list of files. I will then see the pull request and either merge your files into the organization's content or request that you change something before doing so.
