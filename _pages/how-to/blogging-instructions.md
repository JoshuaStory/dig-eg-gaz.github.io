## 1. Fork the repository

Make a copy of the organization repository on your personal github account.

## 2. Name your post

Open the default file that the forked repository contains in a text editor (such as Atom) and save it with a unique name following this format: `2016-09-01-post-name.md`. Plug in today's date and a distinctive name for your post.

## 3. Fill in the header

## 4. Write a post in markdown and add images

Aim for at least 200 words, but it's fine if you write more. Integrate some links into your post, and use an image or two.

To include images, add a line to your post in the following format: `![Image label](image-file-name.png)`.

## 5. Push your post to the group repository
