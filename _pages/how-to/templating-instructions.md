## Objectives

While parts of the *Egyptian Gazette* were composed fresh each day, much of each issue consisted of templates reapplied with minor or no modifications from issue to issue. As we produce our marked-up version of the newspaper, we can save efforts by reusing templates in our own work. We must remain alert to minor variations, however.

## Recurring elements

Advertisements and financial reports form the greatest part of the templated content, and each is dealt with in a separate section below. Here we discuss a few other miscellaneous templates.

### 1. Daily Weather Report

This element typically appears on page 2. A template is [here](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/boilerplates/blob/master/Daily-Weather-Report.xml). It may be most efficient to use the author view in Oxygen to enter particulars.

### 2. Newspaper Subscriptions

This elementy typically appears on page 2. A template is [here](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/boilerplates/blob/master/Newspaper-Subscriptions.xml). Sometimes material is placed in the middle of these two sections.

## Advertisements

## Financial elements
