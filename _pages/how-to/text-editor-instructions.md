### What program should I use to edit text?

There are [an awful lot of text editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors). Your computer will already contain a plain text editor that should work fine: TextEdit is loaded on Macs, and Notepad is bundled with Windows. For more features, try [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) on Mac or [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) on any platform. For more on simple text editing, see this [plain text tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown).
