[This powerpoint presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vMoj-5ktfUAsfXrEbQJqy8vSsKhYiVyGVIZZqefrJW0/edit?authuser=0) displays the page content structure of several issues during the month of July 1905. The main boilerplate is six pages long. On Wednesday and Saturday, when issues are eight pages, the extra pages are the fourth and fifth pages. Pages 6-8 of extended editions correspond to pages 4-6 of regular editions. [This table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/118Zv13fpHfm67i1k0Sm79OThV4ApD-d1iccvrpw1iYU/edit?authuser=0) lists items commonly present in issues of the *Egyptian Gazette*. For a given date, the page and column number are listed. [Ad boilerplates](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/advertisements) are stored on a separate page.
