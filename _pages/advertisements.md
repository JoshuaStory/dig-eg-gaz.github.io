Advertisements in the *Egyptian Gazette* were produced using boilerplates that repeated from issue to issue with minor variations. This digital version will employ a database for these advertisement, cutting and pasting the text as necessary. Each advertiser is given a three-letter code, and each distinct ad from that advertiser is given a numeric suffix. The database lists those codes.

Database available [here](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/advertisements/blob/master/ads-db.tsv)
