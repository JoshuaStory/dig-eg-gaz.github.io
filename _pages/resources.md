If you would like to learn more about Slack, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6zVzWU95Sw) video!

Slack is the standard for communication in technical teams, but it's gaining traction as an email replacement in a very wide variety of companies and organizations.  Slack supports integrations with a wide variety of services and applications.

**But how does it do its magic?** Slack organizes all communication into dedicated channels, where people can have focused conversations, and can always find a place to ask important questions.


### Boilerplates

[This powerpoint presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vMoj-5ktfUAsfXrEbQJqy8vSsKhYiVyGVIZZqefrJW0/edit?authuser=0) displays the page content structure of several issues during the month of July 1905.

The main boilerplate is six pages long. On Wednesday and Saturday, when issues are eight pages, the extra pages are the fourth and fifth pages. Pages 6-8 of extended editions correspond to pages 4-6 of regular editions.

[This table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/118Zv13fpHfm67i1k0Sm79OThV4ApD-d1iccvrpw1iYU/edit?authuser=0) lists items commonly present in issues of the EG. For a given date, the page and column number are listed.
