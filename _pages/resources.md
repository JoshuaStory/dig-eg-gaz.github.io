[Slack Team](dig-eg-gaz.slack.com) - the team where you can communicate with classmates, and get help with the git platform. Slack is the standard for communication in technical teams, but it's gaining traction as an email replacement in a very wide variety of companies and organizations. Slack organizes all communication into dedicated channels, where people can have focused conversations, and can always find a place to ask important questions. If you would like to learn more about Slack, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6zVzWU95Sw) video.
