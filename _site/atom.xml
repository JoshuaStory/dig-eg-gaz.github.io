			<summary>Analyzing the trials and triumphs of the IFS2116 coursework</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="/technical/caliendo-technical-reflection/">&lt;p&gt;When I signed up for this course, I was quite unclear about what exactly the coursework would entail. But, the idea of translating newspaper pages to text as a way of research was intriguing to me, and it was enough of a reason to register for this abstract class. When I began my journey through this course, I immediately faced many technical problems. Foremost, learning how to scan the microfilm of the newspaper pages was somewhat challenging. It took about 30 minutes of messing around with the machine to finally figure out how to even begin to scan the pages I needed, and once I did figure this out, it seemed almost impossible to get all of the text on the page to show up clearly in the scan. Either some portions were too dark, or too light, or sometimes not even displayed on the scan. But eventually I came to terms with the imperfections, and managed to get what I thought would be workable images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step of the process was to OCR the page images, and this was the most troubling step. After countless hours of trial and error with ABBYY, I decided to switch to Cisdem, and this offered somewhat of a better solution in terms of final product. However I found that it was very difficult to get the program to read the newspaper page in the correct order, so I was forced to reorder all of the scanned text in order for it to match up with the paper. Not to mention, the absolutely countless amount of textual errors that came with the OCR. As a result, I spent nearly 3 hours for each single page just correcting the text to make it perfect. Luckily, the XML process in all of this seemed like my saving grace. Although there was definitely a learning curve at first, once I got the hang of the structural tags, I was able to code all of the text quite simply, and It became more of an issue of time and tedious work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although my technical reflection is mostly negative, I do feel that this class enabled me to gain a set of very unique skills that I probably would have never acquired had it not been for this class.&lt;/p&gt;

			<summary>Why isn&#39;t anyone worried?!?</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="/serial%20question/Corzo-SerialQuestion/">&lt;p&gt;For my serial question I would like to investigate the lack of reporting on a widespread plague that is spreading through Egypt and taking lives. I have noticed in my section newspaper that there is currently a plague going on and it seems to me by the article lengths that are getting written about it that the Egyptian gazette doesn’t really care. Recently when ebola and other diseases have ravaged the US in a way, big newspapers like the New York Times or the Washington Post have written very large pieces on the disease and on efforts to stop it. I would like to look into how devastating the diseases has been to the area as well as how far it has spread. I would like to also find out if other newspapers at the time were reporting on it or not. The goal is to see if there was an alternative motive behind the Egyptian gazette’s lack of reporting on the plague spreading through Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I will go about this is by looking at all the deaths in Alexandria in the year and seeing the causes. Also I will see any other types of illnesses and diseases that might have been going around in the year 1905. Also I will look at outside sources to see if the Egyptian gazette was under reporting this plague.&lt;/p&gt;

			<summary>A look into the effect of major global events as evident in the Egyptian Gazette&#39;s writers</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="/Wills-Final-Paper-Blog/">&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Egyptian Gazette, and specifically the year 1905, many of the worlds
major powers resided in Europe and Asia, while the continent of Africa was behind.  For my
cereal question, I would like to take a look into the influence some of these major European and
Asian powers had evident in the Egyptian newspaper.  More specifically, I would like to look into
the results of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, how it upset Russia, and the preparedness of Egypt in
he case of a global conflict.  Along with looking into these storylines throughout the issue, I
would like to create an interactive map of sorts, labeling the main positions of these storylines.&lt;br /&gt;
If the user was to select a point on the map, a brief explanation of the situation, along with a
date would show up.  In my analysis I would like generally discuss Egypt’s reactions, their
opinions on the global treaties, as well as the effects of the agreements between foreign
nations.  I would mostly like to focus on the influence of England, and the resulting reactions of
Russia to movements made by the English, as they would regularly lead to a series of other
reactions.  Querying has resulted in a good amount of topics regarding Egyptian-English
relations, as well as on the topic of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, and through varying the search
queries, plenty of data is available regarding this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visual aid of this project is a map utilizing the app Palladio.  After spending hours
attempting to find a way to save the Palladio file, the discovery of there being no way was made.
In order for the map to be viewed, the text line at the bottom of this blog must be copied and
pasted into an editing software, such as oxygen.  Once the line of text has been pasted, this
oxygen file must be saved.  Using the second link at the bottom of the page, select load an existing
project, then upload this saved oxygen file to this page, and the map will become visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy and paste this line into an editor software, save it, upload to page in next URL:&lt;/strong&gt;

			<summary>Another life taken by the plague. Wait what plague?</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="/curiosities/Corzo-TheSilentKiller/">&lt;p&gt;Imagine reading the one of the leading newspapers in the country and coming upon the local and general section. You read about current court cases, the recent parade happening downtown etc. and then you read that yet another person has died from the plague. You think about how devastating the plague has been to the country… Wait there’s a plague?
In the middle of the 1905 summer on June 16, the Egyptian Gazette reported that another person has died from the plague in a hospital in Damanhour. This report in the newspaper took up literally 2 lines and was probably over looked by the majority of readers. To me it seems that a widespread plague should receive a little more attention than that. Actually a lot more attention. What was the death toll at this point? How far had the plague spread? Are there any treatments being developed for the disease? What are the symptoms? All seem like plausible questions to be asked and reported on by the newspaper but haven’t been. They treated the plague as if it were just as common as the weather report. In only 2 other pages in my week was the plague reported, each being no longer than the report on the 16th.
This odd occurrence begs the question of why hadn’t the newspaper reported something of this magnitude more rigorously? Also it brings up the chilling question of what if the newspaper did it on purpose. What if they had an alternative motive? Regardless of alternative motive or blatant ignorance, the population was being misled regarding the matter of the plague. What else were they being misled about?&lt;/p&gt;

			<summary>Houston, We have a problem</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="/technical/Corzo-TechnicalDifficulties/">&lt;p&gt;Anytime you learn something new, there are problems to come along with it. To try new things and learn new things you will have to face a little bit of adversity. This semester in Digital Microhistory I learned basically a whole new language by learning xml and some coding. This task definitely came with its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent issues that arose was learning the xml language itself. Marking text with “div” tags and all the others was very confusing and sometimes tedious. It seemed that every time I added a tag or edited something, the program oxygen would add another error to my document. The right side of my document was filled with red indicating I had multiple errors. Eventually I learned how to fix them and completely it the right way. Although some errors were fixed by miracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue that I had was taking the actual pictures of the microfilm in the basement of strozier. The quality of the microfilm was short or awesome and made it harder for me to take a clear picture no matter what attributes I changed on the picture. This difficulty just made the process longer and more time consuming. One thing that would’ve made the process a whole lot easier was if the OCR program would have scanned the microfilm more accurately, reducing the amount of time spent having to edit the text afterwards. Overall through the challenges I learned a lot of new skills that will be useful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="/curiosities/the-evolution-of-cigarette-advertising/">&lt;p&gt;In 1970, Congress passed the &lt;strong&gt;Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act&lt;/strong&gt;, which prohibited the advertisement of cigarettes, and this law took effect on January 2, 1971. As a result, I have never seen a pro-cigarette advertisement a day in my life. And clearly, that reality differs from that of people who lived in Alexandria in 1905. Here, the Egyptian Gazette, on page three of this issue, is pushing the reader to check out an advertisement for the Cleopatra Cigarette Company, just in case they skimmed over it while reading page one  just moments before. In essence, not only does the “Gazette” advertise for this cigarette company on the very first page of their newspaper, but they also refer the reader back to that advertisement in a later section of the paper, and in doing so, they are essentially advertising for Cleopatra Cigarettes two times in one issue. This just goes to show how lax people’s views on cigarettes were back in 1905. This newspaper “begs” the reader to check out an advertisement for cigarettes, hoping that they’ll end up purchasing the &lt;em&gt;cancer sticks&lt;/em&gt; for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is beautifully juxtaposed with modern society’s view on cigarettes. For one, in 2016, you would never find an advertisement for cigarettes in a local newspaper. Moreover, there are a plethora of campaigns in existence today which put out ads and commercials to influence people to not smoke, or to stop smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/blog-images/cigs-1x-1.jpeg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one example of the many types of ads in existence today, aiming to make society aware of the side effects of smoking cigarettes. Being surrounded and exposed by so many negative advertisements like this, it makes me question what my view on cigarettes would be if I lived in 1905 Alexandria, and was exposed to positive ads for cigarettes. Not to mention, how I would feel if my local newspaper advertised cigarettes. And moreover, if my local newspaper advertised their own cigarette advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html" xml:base="/serial/Fling-Serial-Question/">&lt;p&gt;In my week of the Gazette I came across a Ship that caught
on fire. This report was found on page 3 of November 25, 1905.
The ship was full of cotton and rice when it was
set aflame. Flames were not visible but smoke was pouring
out from the vessel. The smoke calmed due to incessant pumping
for about 2 hours. But soon after the ship fire seemed to be
controlled, the smoke bursted forth again.
2 hours later, it was decided that the ship was to be put
ashore, on the bank in hopes that the hold would fill with
water to subdue the fire. This did the trick and finally
calmed the fire upon the ship.
Oddly, the cause of the fire is reported as,
“unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section of the newspaper seems to report the most
severe of fires. I am curious, as to what the other weeks of the
Egyptian Gazette will have to offer about such fires. My serial
question for the 1905 Egyptian Gazette will be: How often did
the Egyptian Gazette report Fires in 1905? I will also be researching
why these fires occurred. In this instance, the cause of the Fire is
known. I wonder if the Gazette often list the cause to these fires
as known.&lt;/p&gt;

			<summary>Deaths in Alexandria</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="/questions/deaths/causes/maps/summa-serial/">&lt;p&gt;For my serial question, I would like to explore all of the deaths in
Alexandria that occurred during the year 1905. Once I have collected
all of the articles and blurbs that mention deaths in the Egyptian
Gazette, I will conduct further analysis by assigning specific locations
to those deaths that provide such information. Then, I will be able to
use these locations to create a map of deaths throughout the city. In
order to ensure a comprehensive analysis, if not enough deaths are tagged
with a specific location, I will also create a pie chart showing the
distribution of cause of death. If enough locations are tagged in the
paper, I will color code the causes of death before plotting them on the
map, which should help to give a general overview of which causes of
death are relevant in certain parts of the city, or if any correlation
exists at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important analysis to conduct because it should hopefully
shed some light on the reasons for death, ages of death, and locations
of death throughout Alexandria. By delving into this topic, I hope to
answer the question “How did people die in Alexandria in 1905?” and draw
parallels to the causes of death now and how the two differ.&lt;/p&gt;

			<summary>New technology always leads to technical issues, it&#39;s important to know their causes.</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="/technical/rymer-technical/">&lt;p&gt;A large portion of this class involves using completely new technologies and applying them to very difficult media.  While technologies such as github, OCR, and
XML weren’t terribly hard to learn, the application of them for the first time definitely led me to some technical errors that had to be sorted out.  These technical errors
included poor text recognition that left much of the text unusable, difficult to obtain XML software, and incorrect XML tagging.  The first of these errors can be attributed
to poor condition of century old documents.  While I was able to focus the microfilm reader very well, many portions of these documents had text that was copied slightly on
top of itself and occasionally with weak ink.  This led to problems such as columns being mixed together, text that didn’t go through OCR at all, and many errors overall.
Another technical error I faced was incorrect XML tagging.  After I made all the divs in a page cascade perfectly, I found out that I had tagged headers and subheaders using
the wrong tags, which was solved using find and replace and also a lot of rearranging of the XML.  Overall, I was able to understand these new technologies fairly smoothly,
and I was able to determine the cause of a few technical errors that came up.&lt;/p&gt;

			<summary>A serial question that examines trend in cotton exports to different countries</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="/serial%20questions/grieco-cotton-serial-question/">&lt;p&gt;For my serial question, I will be examining the trends in cotton exports to different countries using the monthly “Coton” table included in the financial section of the &lt;em&gt;Egyptian Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, I will be looking to see whether there are any variations in export volume (measured in bales) due to changes in season, significant domestic and international historical events, or any other major influences of demand. Particularly, this serial question gives me the unique opportunity to examine how complex international relationships at the turn of the century between Great Britain and other states might have trickled down to affect more localized factors, such as cotton exportation from one of its most valued colonies. I believe this questions reflects the spirit of one of the principal goals of this course.&lt;/p&gt;
