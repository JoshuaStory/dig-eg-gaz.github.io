                    <dateline>Aden, July 12.</dateline>
                    <p>The Turks are preparing to advance in great force from Hodeida and Tais
                        simultaneously against Sanaa. It is feared that the rising will become
                        general. (Reuter.) </p>
                    <p>“Die Post” gives the following summary of the position in the Yemen :— </p>
                    <p>The insurrectionary movement in the Yemen has given the Ottoman authorities
                        more trouble than ever, though the military authorities appear to be acting
                        with the necessary energy to prevent any further extension and continuation
                        of the troubles, which might lead to a most serious situation in conjunction
                        with the disturbances in the European portion of the Empire. A Turkish
                        officer who has returned from Arabia gives the following interesting details
                        which are not marked by any excessive optimism. </p>
                    <p>He states that the number of the followers of tho insurgent Sheikh Mohamed
                        Yehya, instead of reaching 150,000 men, does not greatly exceed 40,000. At
                        the opening of the campaign not more than four or five thousand armed
                        guerillas were in the field, but their numbers rose rapidly as the Arab
                        troops of the Turkish Expeditionary Corps surrendered to them and the
                        Yemenis, emboldened by each of their successes and especially by the capture
                        of Sanaa, joined them. The present strength of the rebels is formidable
                        enough, if the climatic conditions, from which the Turkish soldier suffers
                        terribly, are taken into account, </p>
                    <p>Tho present Turkish force consists of three full brigades — Albanians, Lazes,
                        and Turks, who are absolutely reliable, unlike the Syrian and Arab
                        conscripts. The despatch of soldiers to the front continues. Meantime the
                        communications and transport of the force are being assured and a large
                        number of transport mules are being sent from the Syrian Coast to the
                        Arabian ports. </p>

                    <head>MESOPOTAMIA. SIR Wm. WILLCOCKS’S SCHEME.</head>
                    <p>Sir William Willcocks’s scheme for the irrigation of Mesopotamia is made the
                        excuse for a letter in the “National Zeitung," again pleading for the
                        participation of British capital in the construction of the Bagdad Railway.
                        The letter declares that the English see in the irrigation scheme a
                        possibility of obtaining the construction of the Bagdad-Basra section of the
                        line, which, the writer asserts, will be cheaper than the southern (?
                        northern) portion, as it presents no natural difficulties, and, therefore,
                        Germany must not allow it to fall into British hands. The letter continues:—
                        “In view of the Emperor's great personal influence in the East, Sir William
                        Willcocks will not prevail with the Sultan; but I am convinced that if Great
                        Britain and Germany combined their interests, the desired concession would
                        be granted.” The writer then expatiates on the beneficial effects to be
                        expected from irrigation in Mesopotamia by promoting cotton-growing and the
                        cultivation of corn, barley, dates and tobacco. These benefits, he thinks,
                        would be felt by the Bagdad Railway, which would profit by the increased
                        passenger and goods traffic. He concludes by expressing the hope that Sir
                        William Willcocks’s scheme may be amalgamated with the Bagdad Railway, so
                        that Germany, France (who is already interested to the extent of 40 per
                        cent. of the capital), and Great Britain would take part in it. He declares,
                        however, that the management of the whole undertaking must remain in German
                        hands.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE GRAND MUFTI. IMPOSING FUNERAL.</head>
                    <p>A large crowd assembled at the Cairo station about 2 o’clock yesterday
                        afternoon to await the arrival of the special train conveying the mortal
                        remains of the late Sheikh Mohamed Abdou from Alexandria for interment in
                        the Capital. The train drew up at platform No. 1. exactly at 2.36 p.m. and
                        as soon as it came to a standstill the many who had accompanied the body
                        from Alexandria dismounted and swelled the number who were waiting on the
                        platform. The large assembly then gathered round the carriage in which the
                        coffin had been placed. When the doors were opened, and the bearers had
                        mournfully raised the bier on their shoulders the crowd parted and silently
                        stood aside to admit the passage of the coffin, which was carried to a room
                        opening on to the platform, there to await the appointed hour-of four
                        o'clock when the funeral cortege would leave the station. The room in which
                        the coffin lay was closed and guarded by four policemen. </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the crowd grew larger and larger, but the people were not admitted
                        to the platform, which was reserved for those who were to form the cortege,
                        and the entrance soon became so crowded that access to the platform was a
                        matter of considerable difficulty. Shortly after half-past three the
                        mourners began to arrive and increased in numbers continuously until 4 p.m.
                        Every Ministry and public office was fully represented ; Egyptian and
                        English officials alike had come to pay their last homage to a man who had
                        played throughout his public life an eventful part in the Mohamedan world of
                        Egypt, and who had gained the respect and admiration of all who came in
                        contact with him, even of those who actively opposed his ideas and schemes. </p>
                    <p>At four o’clock the coffin was carried out of the room where it had been laid
                        and the procession, leaving the station by the side exit, started on its way
                        to the place of burial. The procession was headed by an officer of the
                        mounted police, and after him came twelve other mounted police, who were
                        followed by fifty foot police in double file. Next came the coffin, a simple
                        bier without adornment, and only covered by a cloth, as is the custom with
                        those belonging to the Mohamedan religion, and this was carried by ten men,
                        several of whom wore the green turban. The bier was followed by a large
                        number of the students of the University of Al Azhar, and these were
                        followed by the lawyers and judges of the Native Tribunals in their robes of
                        office. The English representatives of the various Ministries and public
                        offices and of the Army of Occupation followed. Mr. P. W. Machell, Adviser
                        to the Ministry of the Interior, the Hon. C. James, Mr. Moberley, Mansfield
                        Pasha, Commandant of Police, Brig.-General Bollock, Sir H. Pinching,
                        Director General of the Sanitary Department, Mr. Goodman, Mr. W. Swanson,
                        representing the Ministry of Public Instruction, and many others had come to
                        take part in this procession, and behind these was a large number of those
                        who have been connected with the work of the deceased. </p>
                    <p>It was an immense and most impressive and solemn cortege, and as it passed
                        along it was swelled by the crowds who lined the streets. All traffic in the
                        streets through which the procession passed was stopped, and the huge crowds
                        stood silent and respectful until it had passed them. It appeared indeed as
                        if the whole native population of Cairo had come to pay their last respects
                        to the great Sheikh, and Europeans were also present in large numbers. The
                        procession passed along Sharia Bab-el-Hadid, Sharia Kamel and Opera-square,
                        where the English representatives left it, and it then continued across
                        Ataba el-Khadra-square, the Mousky, and Sikkat Guedidah to the Mosque of Al
                        Azhar, where the customary ceremony previous to interment took place, and
                        there the procession was reformed and wended its way to the cemetery of
                        Megawreen, where the body was laid in its final resting place. </p>

                    <byline>( From our Correspondent. )</byline>
                    <dateline>London, July 12.</dateline>
                    <p>A very pretty wedding took place to-day at St. George’s Church,
                        Hanover-square. where Captain Charles Wilberforce Maclean, of the Lancashire
                        Fusiliers, (attached to the Egyptian Army), son of the late Colonel Allan
                        Maclean, R. A., and grandson of the late General Maclean, of Rowlands,
                        Wimborne, and Lazoneby Hall, Cumberland, was married to Miss Gladys Royle,
                        only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Royle, of Cairo. </p>
                    <p>St. George’s Church, Hanover-square, specially popular for smart weddings,
                        and within the past month both the King and Queen, with Princess Victoria,
                        were present there for Lady Alexandra Acheson’s marriage with the Earl of
                        Derby’s son. The music and singing are of a very high-class order, and Dr.
                        Jolly, the organist, played finely at to-day’s wedding, as he has done at
                        previous ceremonies, his choir acquitting themselves admirably. The hymns
                        sung were, “Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us” and “O perfect Love!” While
                        the register was being signed Mendelssohn’s anthem from Elijah, “He shall
                        give His Angels charge over thee,” rendered beautifully, and the Wedding
                        March was a splendid finale. Mr. Douglas Morice and Mr. Maclean, the
                        bridegroom’s brother, acted as ushers and the numerous guests were shown to
                        the seats appointed for them without the slightest confusion or delay. </p>
                    <p>The ceremony was performed by the Rev. David Anderson, Rector of St.
                        George’s, who at the head of the choir met the bride at the entrance of the
                        church and preceded her to the altar. There the bridegroom was waiting
                        attended by his best man, Major Hawker, Coldstream Guards. Miss Royle, who
                        was given away by her father, wore a lovely Princess robe of rich Brussels
                        applique lace over silvered net, and trimmed at the foot with a Vandyck
                        flounce, from which branches of embroidered raised silver lilies tapered to
                        the waist, the leaves of the flowers being edged with a tiny lace frill. A
                        spray of the embroidery crossed the corsage, which was softened by a large
                        square lace collar, and there were pretty lace elbow sleeves. With this robe
                        was worn a courttrain of gauged spot net each gauging separated by a band of
                        fine old point de Gaze lace, and garlands of the embroidered silver lilies
                        were introduced, matching the embroidery on the robe. The bride wore no
                        ornaments. Her tulle veil fell over a chaplet of orange blossoms and she
                        carried a sheaf of white lilies. The brides maids were Miss Victoria Royle,
                        Miss Hermie and Miss Violet Beauchamp (the bride’s cousins), Miss Daisy and
                        Miss Gertrude Maclean (sisters of the bridegroom), Miss Margaret Maclean
                        (his cousin), Miss Ella Rayne, and Miss Ethel Lambert. They wore charming
                        gowns of white blonde lace on soft white satin, the bottom of the skirts
                        trimmed with Empire wreaths of pink chiffon roses, set in by garlands of
                        blue ribbon, run through the lace. The tops of the bodices were
                        transparent,—and two bretelles of blue ribbon, veiled in lace, crossed the
                        shoulders and finished under a deep folded belt of blue satin, trimmed at
                        the back with little rosettes and short folded ends. A butterfly bow of lace
                        was fastened in the front of the bodice with festoons of the pink rose; with
                        small green foliage falling at each side. The elbow sleeves were in two
                        puffs, divided by a bracelet of blue ribbon and a single pink rose, and
                        terminated in lace ruffles. The pretty hats were made of white tulle,
                        narrowly frilled with blonde lace. The round brims were very much raised off
                        the face in front, and to one side, and out away at the back, which was
                        filled in with a bow, and ends of wide blue ribbon edged with lace. The
                        crowns were encircled by a band of blue ribbon and inside on the raised brim
                        were a large cluster of little pink roses and foliage and a blue bow. The
                        bridegroom gave the bridesmaids bouquets of pink banksia roses tied with
                        blue streamers, and turquoise and pearl pendants- dresses, hats, bouquets
                        and ornaments making a beautiful harmony of delicate pompadour colouring. </p>
                    <p> After the ceremony, Mrs. Royle held a reception at 22, Charles St.,
                        Barkeley-sqnare, kindly lent by Miss Warmald, which was numerously and

                    <head>CAIRO WATER SUPPLY. DR. BITTER'S REPORT.</head>
                    <p>We have received from the Cairo Water Company Dr. Bitter’s report upon the
                        water as at present supplied to the greater number of the Cairo districts
                        from the artesian wells at Rod-el-Farag, and we give below a translation of
                        this report:— </p>
                    <p>“The water of the wells is absolutely clear and limpid and without colour. It
                        has no smell and is of a very pleasant taste. Its temperature is 23 Cent.
                        The water contains no bacteria and is sterile. </p>
                    <p>“In comparing the chemical analysis of the well-water and of the Nile water
                        one sees that there is no very pronounced difference between the two. There
                        is only the hydrometric degree which was greater in the case of the
                        well-water. </p>
                    <p>“During the time of the high Nile the well-water is about twice as hard as
                        the Nile water, but this difference decreases during low Nile, to such an
                        extent that, during the month of May for example, the rates of hydrometric
                        degree of the two waters is reduced to 7 : 5. </p>
                    <p>“The high hydrometric degree of the well water is due to the presence of a
                        larger quantity of calcium bicarbonate and magnesium bicarbonate, and not to
                        an increase in the quantity of calcium sulphate. On the contrary, the
                        well-water contains less sulphuric acid than the Nile water, especially when
                        the Nile is at low-water mark. </p>
                    <p>“In other respects the hydrometric degree of the well-water is very moderated
                        and the water of the Embabeh wells can be considered as a very sweet water.
                        A considerable amount of the water used for drinking in the large towns of
                        England, Germany, and France him the same degree of hardness or is even
                        still harder. A water is generally considered as distinctly hard only when
                        its hydrometric degree exceeds 30 French degrees, and the hydrometric degree
                        of the well-water of Embabeh is about 20. </p>
                    <p>“The calcium contained in the well-water is almost exclusively in the form of
                        calcium bicarbonate and gives to this water a particularly fresh and
                        agreeable taste, which we are accustomed to find in good water springs. This
                        constitutes a real advantage in comparison with Nile water, which contains
                        much less carbonic acid. The well water also contains less sodium chloride
                        than the Nile water. During low Nile the amount of salt found in Nile water
                        is about 2 1/2 times as great as that found in the well-water. </p>
                    <p>One can consider the well-water as having the same origin as the Nile water,
                        i.e., as a Nile water naturally filtered through beds of soil. But this
                        filtration has not taken place in the proximity of the wells; it must have
                        traversed for a considerable length the underground beds, as is proved by
                        the differences in the chemical analyses and by the constant temperature of
                        the well-water (a temperature equal to the annual mean temperature). It may
                        thus be described as the water of the subterranean Nile which accompanies
                        the superficial Nile and has the same origin as the latter. </p>
                    <p>“The taste of the Nile water does not differ sensibly from that of the
                        well-water. Most people, and especially the Arabs, are unable to distinguish
                        with certainty the two waters, as I have been able to prove by direct
                        experiments. </p>
                    <p>“The well-water is a drinkable water of the first quality as much from the
                        point of chemical analysis as from the point of taste, and especially from
                        the fact that it is absolutely free of living germs. </p>
                    <p>“Being given the geological configuration of the aquiferous beds and the
                        construction of the wells it is absolutely impossible for this water to
                        become contaminated by the filration of unhealthy water. During the three
                        years that two of these wells have been worked almost continuously day and
                        night to the amount of about 4,000 cubic metres each per day, the chemical
                        composition of the water has remained unchanged. </p>
                    <p>“The water of the Embabeh wells ranks, therefore, amongst the best of the
                        natural drinking waters known, and the town Cairo may be congratulated on
                        possessing a supply of drinkable water which is no way inferior to the best
                        waters of the whole world.” </p>

                    <p>mousseline de soie richly incrusted with renaissance lace in handsome design.
                        The bodice was draped en bolero with front of the mousseline de soie,
                        inserted with lace, and there was a folded belt of soft white satin, the
                        belt and bodice trimmed prettily with little satin bows. The picture hat was
                        of white tulle in soft cloudy frills, and with a wreath of pink heather and
                        roses round the crown, tied at the back with a blue ribbon bow. Mrs. Boyle
                        wore a most becoming gown made of light blue satin veiled in blue chiffon
                        and again in chiffon of a rich tone of purple. The skirt was finely gauged
                        and trimmed at the foot with garlands of chiffon. An effective touch was a
                        band of wide chene ribbon at the foot on the blue chiffon underskirt,
                        showing through with charming result. The gauged bodice had frills of creamy
                        silk lace about the neck, and a bow of blue and silver shot tissue was
                        fastened at the bust, and the waistband was of purple ribbon. On the
                        graceful sleeves, the pale blue chiffon appeared as small puffs under a
                        loose elbow sleeve veiled by the darker fabric. The toque, smartly turned up
                        at the wide back, was slightly pealed in front, and made of tulle matching
                        the gown, embroidered with ribbon straw to match ribbon and finished by a
                        handsome purple ostrich feather. Mrs. Murray Cookesley, who gave the bride
                        her fine painting of “Circe resplendens” as a wedding present, wore a
                        picturesque dress designed by herself, made of pearl great voile, under a
                        tunic of rare gold lace, the bodice embroidered with pearls. A pearl fringe
                        finished the white satin sleeves, and there was a belt of the same satin.
                        The toque was composed of grey ostrich feathers and white roses.</p>
