                    <head>SPORT AND THE NATIONS.</head>
                    <p>How cosmopolitan modern- sport is becoming ! The reflection is inevitable on
                        reading the home papers of last week. Never surely was there a time when the
                        nations were so mingled in friendly rivalry, when so many international
                        contests were proceeding simultaneously. All the papers are full of it, so
                        full that we have almost been tempted to forget that other and grimmer kind
                        of "test match" whioh has been in progress in the Black Sea and in Eastern
                        Asia. </p>
                    <p>During the past week or two the representatives of different peoples have
                        been competing against one another in many ways. The champions of Great
                        Britain have been waging stubborn warfare with the best players <cb/> of
                        Australia on the tented field, in the finest of all games that man has
                        devised. It was a Homeric match, and if the brilliant play of the home side
                        did not give them the victory, they must feel, as Britons, proud of the bull
                        dog tenacity which enabled the Australians to stave off defeat. England,
                        too, has been at hard grips with another branch of the Anglo-Saxon race
                        elsewhere. At Wimbledon the Australian cracks were just beaten for the
                        doubles in the lawn-tennis tournament by the Englishmen, Smith and Riseley.
                        But the true champion in this contest is Miss Sutton, the young Californian
                        girl who has been giving our English ladies new ideas on the game. </p>
                    <p>Perhaps even more generally interesting was the duel between England and
                        America at Henley. The race between Leander and Vesper for the Grand
                        Challenge Cup was the event of the regatta. The hopes of Americans ran high,
                        as they did two years ago, when the Philadelphians entered for the cup, and
                        if the Vesper crew had succeeded in bringing back the trophy with them the
                        people of the United States would have been hard put to it to find adequate
                        expression for their enthusiasm. A fresh element of interest was added to
                        the contest on this occasion. The Belgian crew from Ghent proved
                        unexpectedly strong, and won their heat with exemplary ease, and there was
                        even an apprehension in the minds of some onlookers at one moment that
                        Leander, having disposed of the Americans, might themselves succumb to the
                        redoubtable Flemings. Beyond the Channel all the world was exciting itself
                        over the great motor race for the Gordon Bennett Cup, with England, France,
                        Germany, Austria, Italy, and the United States all represented. Motor racing
                        seems to us a foolish, dangerous, and useless pursuit, whioh ought to be
                        discouraged ; but international it assuredly is. Then on Monday began the
                        Bisley meeting, where our best shots will have to hold their own against the
                        picked riflemen from across the ocean. </p>
                    <p>Sport, then, it seems, is now a real bond between the nations. There is a
                        useful give and take, a pleasant interchange in these matters. A French
                        horse may win the Derby. </p>
                    <p>An English driver might have carried off the Gordon Bennett Cup. The
                        Americans have beaten us on the running ground, and we may be sure they will
                        try and try again at Henley until they defeat Leander, perhaps to find
                        themselves in their turn worsted by a crew from the Meuse or the Rhine. For
                        it seems that Continental athletes know how to row, just as they are even
                        learning to play cricket. </p>
                    <p>This is one of the incidental advantages of international sport. It not only
                        enables the nations to know one another, but it helps them to take the
                        advice of the Greek sage, and to know themselves. It knocks a little of the
                        conceit out of them. The time was when we thought that excellence in
                        athletic exercises was our own monopoly—the natural birthright of the
                        Briton. We should have laughed at the notion that a Frencb man, a Belgian, a
                        German, could be a real sportsman, could equal us in a fair trial of
                        strength, courage, and nerve. We know better now. We know that our
                        superiority was mainly a matter of training and practice. The other peoples,
                        when they prepare themselves in the same fashion as ourselves, do very well.
                        We hold our own still, but we have to fight hard for first place against
                        foemen who have no natural inferiority. That, at any rate, ought to do
                        something to rub off national and racial prejudices. Sport is a fine
                        democratic leveller. It teaches the peoples to respect one another, since it
                        shows that the sportsman may come from any country which take the trouble to
                        teach him rightly, and give him fitting encouragement for the development of
                        his powers. </p>

                    <p>Interesting as the announcement is that the Olympic games of Greece are to be
                        revived, one rather hesitates to extend all unrestrained welcome to the
                        project until its details take more definite shape. The attempts that have
                        hitherto been made to imitate the historic meeting have turned out decidedly
                        second-class affairs. It is a difficult task that the organisers have before
                        them. To strike the elusive thread on success, the revival must neither be
                        too painstakingly archaic nor too painfully modern. It must evade the
                        similitude of a Barnum show on the one hand, and of a bicycle gymkhana on
                        the other. Simplicity is the first requisite. Let there be no crimson cloth
                        or blare of trumpets. The second is the presence of really representative
                        athletes. In this connection we are glad to see that an earnest effort is
                        being made to draw on the best talent of England, and a strong British
                        committee has been formed with this object. Given these two primary
                        conditions, the "pulvis Olympicus" may yet perhaps be the scene of a meeting
                        not entirely unworthy of the glorious past. </p>
