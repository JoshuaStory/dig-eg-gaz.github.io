                    <p>Few things are more remarkable in the intellectual development of the last
                        quarter of a century than the growth of archæology as a serious study, no
                        longer to be regarded, like Latin verses, as an elegance or added charm to
                        scholarship. It has altered the whole attitude of men’s minds towards
                        antiquity, and, to seek an analogy in a widely different quarter, may be
                        compared to the substitution of oral evidence for affidavits in the Court of
                        Chancery. The ancient tomb or inscription, statue or remains of a temple,
                        like the living word of the witness, are more likely to tell the truth than
                        any writing. In no department has the progress been more striking than in
                        Egyptology. A few years ago there was at most one exhibition in the year for
                        showing the work done ; now there are always two or three, and the progress
                        has been so great as to make necessary a division of labour. Thus there is
                        now open, for a month, in the library of the Society of Biblical Arcbæology,
                        37, Great Russell street, London, a most interesting display of antiquities,
                        mainly from the eleventh dynasty temple at Deire, Bahari, found daring last
                        season’s work by Dr. Edouard Naville and Mr. Hall. This funerary temple of
                        King Neb-hapet-Ra Meutuhetep (ILL) was discovered in the preceding season,
                        1903 4, and lies to the south of the great temple built by Queen Hatshepsu.
                        Two thirds of it have now been cleared away, and it is hoped that further
                        search may disclose the pyramid tomb of the King himself, which was called
                        Akh-asset, “Glorious are its seats.” From the site the explorers have been
                        allowed to bring home— for distribution among various museums — many
                        valuable, though fragmentary, remains. Had they been more perfect they would
                        perforce have been retained m Egypt. They are of exceptional interest as
                        including specimens of high relief work of which no other examples appear to
                        be extant, and they belong to tho eleventh dynasty, of which we had very
                        little knowledge. These remains have, in fact, opened a new chapter of
                        Egyptian art. The craftsmen of Egypt, like the architects of medieval
                        Cathedrals, are usually unknown by name ; but in this instance the name of
                        the chief artist has come down to us. He was Mertisen, who describes himself
                        on his tombstone as a master of artistic skill which he handed down to his
                        son. It is thought that he was the inaugurator of a new birth of Egyptian
                        art, just as his master, Neb-hap8t-Ra Mentuhetep, was the refounder of the
                        Egyptian kingdom under the headship of the Thebans. Of another King,
                        Usertsen III., three massive statues of black granite—mutilated, it is true,
                        but not to such an extent as to conceal the character of the face—are shown.
                        They represent him at different periods of his life, with a face rather of a
                        European than of an Egyptian or Semitic type. 'The mouth is large, but the
                        lips are thin and firm, and the nose would appear to have been somewhat
                        aquiline. The ears are of enormous size. What appears to be the earliest
                        instance of the newly-discovered eleventh dynasty style of high coloured
                        relief is the seated portrait figure of a Queen or priestess named Nefer
                        shushusa. There are also other similar figures—one with a flower in the left
                        hand, and another smelling a flower. A relief of a King holding the hand of
                        a Queen seems to commemorate a chief of the hunters of the desert by its
                        peculiarly cut inscription. From the shrine of the priestesses comes another
                        high relief sculpture of a man who is represented with the person below him
                        as walking in the temple. The remarkable feature of this fragment is a
                        “proto-Doric” octagonal column, and the whole affords interesting evidence
                        of the actual appearance of the columns of the ambulatory surrounding the
                        pyramid» To the left are two fragments showing the hinder parts of a dog and
                        of a man binding a bull for sacrifice, and above is one of the sacred cows
                        of Hathor licking her calf. Pieces of purely Theban work are two fragments
                        from scenes representing King Mentuhetep and his wife. On the right-hand one
                        is seen the upper part of tho Royal crown, and the beautifully carved
                        hieroglyphs and the wonderful prdservation of colour give singular interest
                        and charm to these remains. The inscriptions refer to the Qneen (Aashait). A
                        complete slab of this type is kept back in the Cairo Museum. A variety of
                        other objects assignable to this period are also shown—the King overthrowing
                        an Aamn, warriors armed with axes, boatmen, and reliefs of animals. The
                        drawing of the latter, notably a flamingo, is marvellously free and
                        accurate. </p>
                    <p>The specimens of later dynasties are of no inferior value and interest. The
                        most beautiful, perhaps, of the objects displayed is an alabaster head of a
                        cow, ascribed to the eighteenth dynasty. The sculpture is wonderfully true
                        to life. The eyes were inlaid with lapis, of which traces remain, and the
                        ears and horns were probably of silver. The cow was probably from a figure
                        of the goddess Hathor, dedicated in the Hathor shrine of the Great Temple. A
                        portion of a large funerary stela commemorates Userhat, priest of the
                        deceased Kings Amen-hotep III. and Tut-ankh-amen, and his wife, the singer
                        of Amen, Nefretari. These are ascribed to the early nineteenth dynasty.There
                        is also a great number of smaller objects— beads,blue-glazed faience, vases,
                        hieratic ostraka containing lists of names, accounts, letters, a literary
                        text, and a list of hieroglyphs which may have been school exercises. It
                        remains to b3 said that Dr. Borchardt contributes a series of very beautiful
                        photographs of the temple, and that Mme. Naville has made some admirable
                        coloured drawings of cows from the eleventh dynasty sarcophagi. It is
                        somewhat curious that the draghtsmanship displayed in work presumably of the
                        same age is very unequal. Some of the cows are freely and nataralistically
                        drawn, whilst others are conventional to the degree of being almost wooden.

                        <p>The House of Commons was again occupied yesterday with the debate upon
                            the Aliens Bill. That is the third full Parliamentary day devoted to the
                            Committee on this measure, and the House has not reached the middle of
                            the first clause. The amendments have been uniformly directed to making
                            the Bill unworkable, or intolerably cumbrous. It is merely a measure of
                            police for the protection of ratepayers from burdens which ought not to
                            be placed upon them, of English workmen from being crowded out of home
                            and employment by some of the lowest populations of Europe, and of
                            society at large from persons incapable of making good citizens. It is
                            constantly treated by the Opposition as if it were an invasion of the
                            rights of man and an attack upon the privileges of persons more worthy
                            of our care than the subjects of the King. </p>

                        <p>The Radicals find themselves in a dilemma, which, as usual, they have
                            made for them selves ; as a witty lady said at the beginning of the last
                            century, “I’ve often heard of people running their heads against stone
                            walls, but I never knew of any but the Whigs who built stone walls to
                            run their heads against” No Radical supports. in ' theory the strange
                            anomaly by which one Member of Parliament represents what may be called
                            a, one-vote power, while another, with only the same privileges in the
                            House of Commons, stands for a ten-vote power. Radicals are mostly
                            ideologues, and equal electoral districts would best coincide with their
                            absurd theories about the literal equality of men, and for that matter
                            of women and men. Why not of men, women, and children Î Therefore, they
                            cannot conscientiously oppose the principle of redistribution. </p>

                            some member would ask for a return showing the number of officers

                            troops in the command, on the one hand, in each British command, and, on
                            the other hand, in a normal French or German division and Army Corps.
                            That return, we suspect, would astonish the House of Commons even more
                            than the report of Sir William Butler’s committee. </p>

                        <p> The suggestion which has been made—it may almost be called a threat—that
                            certain highly placed officials should be impeached, under certain
                            circumstances, in connection with the War Stores scandal, at once takes
                            us back to the days of an earlier generation. One had imagined that
                            Warren Hastings was the last great example of a great impeachment. To
                            day he affair would be less picturesque and dramatic, if not essentially
                            less tragic. Tho galaxy of oratorical talent that made that protracted
                            trial so astounding has passed with the classics from the House of
                            Commons, and oratory as an art is on the down grade. There is, of
                            course, the possibility that an impeachment might serve to revive this
                            lost art, though the possibility lends no sufficient attracting* to the
                            prospect. </p>

                                in fact, is clearly in the hands of the Grand Dukes, who seems
                                destined to furnish one more example to the <cb n="3"/> Royal Houses
                                which have, fallen because they “learn nothing, and forget nothing.”

                            <p>The mob which went looting in Odessa under the shelter of the
                                Potemkin’s guns was doubtless yielding to the imperious temptation
                                of hunger. In such conditions there seems every reason to fear that
                                the struggle for liberty must come to wear more and more the aspect
                                of a class war and a battle for bread, unless the Liberals can find
                                the courage and the means to impose both peace and a Constitution
                                upon the Tsar. </p>

                            <p>Another important article by M. Jules Delafosse, which has made a
                                deep impression in Paris, has appeared in the “Echo de Paris.” He
                                says that France is willing to conclude an understanding with
                                Germany, because that implies a régime of peace, but she will not
                                conclude an alliance with her, because that involves chances of war
                                contrary to the interests of France. M. Delafosse then inquires what
                                the German Emperor had to reproach France with as regards Morocco.
                                His answer is, absolutely nothing. The German Emperor demanded in
                                haughty terms the territorial integrity of Morocco, the independence
                                of the Sultan, and the open door. But those three points were
                                distinctly accepted in the text of the Franco English Agreement.

                            <p>The “Cologne Gazette” declares that in view of the reservations with
                                which M. Ronvier has doubtless accompanied his consent, in this
                                question it is impossible to speak of victor or vanquished. The
                                lesson of the “Franco-German incident” is described as being that
                                “reforms in Morocco can only be achieved by means of an
                                international understanding aid not by the initiative of a single

                        PEOPLE.</head>
                    <p>Though sharing the traditional reluctance of our old nobility to emerge from
                        aristocratic privacy and come before the public-as the subject of a
                        newspaper article, the Right Hon. Lady Haldon has expressly permitted the
                        publication of a statement recently made to a representative of the Press
                        regarding her wonderful cure by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. </p>
                    <p>Recognising that the words of a titled lady in her position must necessarily
                        bear great' weight with the public, and earnestly <figure>

                        </figure> desiring that the benefits she had derived from Dr. Williams’ Pink
                        Pills should be publicly acknowledged. Lady Haldon waived all personal
                        reluctance and told a story which cannot but impress every reader.</p>
                    <p>‘For the sake of all sufferers,” said her ladyship, “I want to tell you what
                        Dr. Williams* Pink "Pills for Pale People did for me when I had given up all
                        hope, after tho best professional treatment. </p>
                    <p>‘I have been a great traveller. Five years ago, when residing Tn Australia,
                        my heart became seriously affected. Symptoms of advanced Anaemia showed
                        themselves. One of the results was most acute Indigestion. I suffered
                        severely in the back and under the shoulder blades, including an especially
                        severe oppression of the chest. The most careful diet brought no relief.
                        Even after a glass of water my discomfort was almost unbearable. Food of any
                        kind caused me snob misery that I ate less and less, till I was practically
                        starving myself. In walking the shortest distance palpitations of the heart
                        would make me feel as though I were suffocating. </p>
                    <p>“As anæmia developed I grew alarmingly ill ; I could not sleep at night ; my
                        whole system was deranged. My nerves broke down, my bead ached constantly,
                        until my eyesight became affected. </p>
                    <p> “My illness seemed so deeply rooted that I determined to go to the Clinique
                        de la Caroline, in Switzerland, where I was attended by eminent physicians. </p>
                    <p>“But about August, 1903, while I was travelling by train and nearly prostrate
                        with one <cb n="4"/> of my attacks, I casually picked up a small pamphlet
                        referring to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. I became so
                        interested in some cures mentioned therein that I determined to give a trial
                        to this medicine.</p>
                    <p>“Within three days I was astonished at the marvelous improvement. I procured
                        further boxes of the pills, and very soon I was delighted to find that all
                        traces of my complaint had practically vanished. </p>
                    <p> “I could now walk long distances with an entire freedom from pain. My
                        appetite had returned with a heartiness that surprised me, and my general
                        health was suoh as I had not enjoyed for many years.” </p>
                    <p>In every class of society the curative powers of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
                        have been proved repeatedly in diseases arising from too little or
                        impoverished blood. For men as well as women they are invaluable in Anæmia,
                        Indigestion, excessive weakness, Decline, Consumption, Rheumatism, Sciatica,
                        Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxy, Nervous Disorders. Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,
